While the interior and exterior are quite unimpressive in aesthetic, the food does in fact compensate. The cooks and wait staff are friendly and are quick to serve and ensure the meal is going well. I typically get the Village Bistro Breakfast; three eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, toast, and french toast. The portions are quite generous, with more than expected for breakfast portions. The french toast is by far my favourite; super fluffy, and more so on the sweet side. The pancakes are also fluffy and come in powdered sugar. Beyond the breakfast selection, they serve some excellent lunch specials!",2,Y9OQzttigHxtqtEbdFLTCA

My account was overdrawn by Chase bank for $133.00 on April 25 2017 allegeeky because a merchant refunded my account $133.00 but prior to the merchant refunding my account the bank gave me a temporary refund of $133.00. So today the bank got there monies back which now has caused a financial hardship due to other bills that will be coming out of this same account within the next few days. Chase bank is all about getting there money not helping the customer. There customer service is the worst I've seen by any bank in years. I suggest if you banking go elsewhere.,0,zINOEuqXL_P7c_pwXrltuA

Kind of like hooters but way better.  Atmosphere, look, cleanliness, food and of course the girls are way better to look at. Way more friendlier as well! I like the log cabin/lodge feel so it made it much more inviting.  

As for the food I got the Bacon Jam Sliders and they were pretty good. Wasn't looking for a full meal but I have to say they filled me up.  Also got the side of bacon! Who doesn't love bacon and when a place has a side of it on their menu you order it.  In luck cause it was awesome.  Very tasty however kind of spicy which I wasn't expecting. The spice was a little much [for me] so it may be perfect for you.  Everyone in my group couldn't get enough of it so I recommend it for sure.  

Beer was good and pretty typical for this type of place. Wish I had checked in to get the free app but I'll save that for another time.

The wait was quite long almost an hour so I would highly recommend you to reserve ahead of time on open table. 


ordered:
*I ordered how half a dozen oysters [$18] which is simply delicious. I would highly recommend it to any of your lovers. 
*I also ordered a quiche [$13.50] which add cheese bacon and onions. It wasn't bad very soft it just in while me. I have definitely had better quiche before. 
*the steak frites [$33.50] comes with fries. we specifically ordered it medium and it was made perfectly medium but lacked in flavor. Which I know they are not a steak house therefore I can't complain at the steak is in that out of this world. *My friend really enjoyed the special of the day which is the wild eggs benedict. He said that the egg was cooked perfectly. 
*My girlfriend had the Gravlax [$16] which came with smoked salmon with a petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato & capers. she enjoyed it however complained because it took too much of her time to have to put everything together. And she's used to eating a salmon lox. everything came separate so you'll have to put it together yourself.  However the salmon is definitely smoke in house as it was not that salty.

Our waitress was awesome!! we have to wait a long time for are oysters and she made sure to tell her manager that we had to wait. basically her colleague messed up and we got the oysters after our food came out. I was able to get us half a dozen oysters for free without of complaining that i had to wait a long time Which is definitely great service. 

prices are kinda on the high side. i really wanted to love this place. I can't give it 5 stars because honestly everything was great [decor, outdoor setting, staff, menu selection] but the food was just average. The best part of my meal was the oysters.

tips: 
*It is located upstairs.
*cash and credit accepted. 
*There's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is very limited. 
*They have cute little Tabasco sauce bottles. 
*There is a Bouchon bakery downstairs.
*they give free samples of their baked goods.
*the waiting area has newspapers you can read.
*you can reserve a table on open table to cut the wait time.

We were seated quickly and asked the server, who was pleasant, what was good since it was our first time there. She named some items and I decided, since it has the semi-appearance of a '50s diner, to order a burger. I asked if the fries were made fresh, since that's a prerequisite in a great diner and was surprised to hear that no, they were frozen. The server said the macaroni salad was made in house, so I went that route. I wasn't asked what temp. I wanted the burger, so that made me a little scared that it was frozen, too. The burger was edible but barely. The mac salad was pure mayo and not much else. My friend had the chicken sandwich special which she said was barely edible also.

Both types (Australian and US wagyu) offered on the AYCE menu were delicious, but I had a slight preference for the Australian - amazing marbling that melts in your mouth. I also tried the kagoshima Japanese a5 wagyu, which came as slightly thicker and longer slices of meat with even more beautiful marbling (extra charge $95 for 300g and $65 for 200g). I would definitely recommend it if you are okay with doubling your bill, but if you're on a budget the regular wagyu is almost as good. The veggies were also fresh and delicious - especially loved the honey sweet potato (but on the menu it said this item was limited)

As for the service, it's a really busy place with a full house and line ups. Sometimes it's a little difficult to get a server's attention but I had no issues with the speed of service.

While simple, the food is full of flavour. I'd say the best part about Lil Baci is the pasta. It's clearly homemade, and the sauces that come with it are super fresh! Pizza is also very nice as well. Like the pasta, all of the ingredients on the pizza are fresh and delicious. The crust and tomato sauce on are what really set them apart from other restaurants i have been to. My only complaint is that the consistency varies. Some nights the pizzas are perfect. Other nights, the pizza is 50% crust! Even though i have only had this happen to me once or twice, i'm sure there must be some difference in skill between the chefs when it comes to making the pizzas. As a regular, it doesn't bother me too much since i know it's a one off, but it wouldn't be a good experience for a first time customer. 

Service is another strong point. The staff are always very friendly and accommodating, and hustle hard to make sure you aren't kept waiting! The sad thing is that despite their best efforts, i have seen many poor reviews on service. I'm not sure if it's just the neighbourhood, but i feel as if many people who come here are extremely finicky and upset by the most trivial problems. For instance, a waiter brought 3 plates of food to a party of 4, and came back 20 seconds with the other plate. After leaving, the table complained that the food did not arrive at once. How silly! Not only can the waiter not carry more than 4 items, but surely waiting 20 seconds for another plate to arrive is not the end of the world! Before writing this review, i took a look at other poor reviews for this restaurant, and realized that most of them are probably written by the highly fussy crowd that goes here. If my server had not suggest that i write a review, i wouldn't have known about these small complaints, many of which i would not take seriously.

Filet Cobb salad is amazing!  Fire Roasted Turkey Dip is amazing - instead of gravy I sub out for the au jus from the french dip sandwich or you can just get the french dip... its amazing!  Got the burger once... just okay.. nothing special.  Love the very thin french fries and the garlic green beans are sometimes the daily vegetable... yummy in my tummy if I choose to sub out fries and be a little healthier.  People love the carrots... they are carmelized and sweet if you like that.  Definitely a must for just about anyone...  prices are mid to high.  Salads are Ahi - $13.99 and filet one is $15.99 during lunch.  Haven't been there for dinner so not sure about that.

Part of my choosing this hotel is b/c of my favorite band The Killers and their album ""Flamingo"". I think that had something to do with it. haha. Anyways, I only started reading the reviews a week before we left and three weeks after booking. It made me kind of nervous reading horrible review after horrible review. It was all I could think about! I was afraid I ruined the vacation before it even started b/c by reading these reviews you would be under the impression that it was the worst hotel ever. I even had to apologize to everybody for booking the room. But after actually staying at the Flamingo and having a great experience I am now wondering if some of these bad reviews are even legit. Everything about our stay was positive. So needless to say, I was worrying for nothing. I couldn't really think of any negatives about our stay. The elevators weren't slow like they said they were. The customer service wasn't as bad as they said it was, in fact...the guy we dealt with was very nice and overly-friendly. The rooms were clean and nice. Beds were comfortable.The water in the bathroom was very hot. The thermostat worked well. Casino had the latest slot machines. We only encountered one timeshare person.

I know they just opened, which is why I gave two stars instead of just one...hoping they can redeem themselves. Here's a rundown: 

 1. $18 for 2 breakfast sandwiches. My (very basic) bagel sandwich alone was $12.
2. Bfast options were listed, but bfast sandwiches were not. Also, bread options & bagel types are not listed. 
3. To be called a deli, the bread options are terrible. Cheap loaf bread. The bagel was tough to chew. Seriously....If we are paying this much for a sandwich, where is the good bread??
4. The sandwiches we ordered were a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich and a lox bagel ""all the way"". The bacon/egg/cheese was lackluster & was served on cheap white loaf bread. The lox bagel came with lox and cream cheese. That's it. No onion. No capers. Lame-tasting bagel. Twelve dollars.

I wasted nothing. And then I had a buttercreme  cupcake on top of that and left with a smile so big my face hurt. 

I went back on Saturday morning and bought more pastries and bear claws and brought them home. Other than the ones I carefully hid the rest of them evaporated in under 5 minutes, the only evidence of their arrival was a few left over crumbs and several huge smiles. Even the jaded people over here fell hard for Chef Flemming's pastries. 

Chef Flemming's Bake Shop is located 1 block South of Lake Mead and Water St. at the entrance to downtown Henderson. It's a small place, if you're not paying attention you might miss it. And you would really be missing out on something very special. Let me put it this way, I have fallen head over heels for this place. I got to meet the Chef himself briefly, nice guy. He's got a staff that takes care of customers without attitude, and he's got a wide selection of things to try. Breads, pies, cupcakes, pastries, brownies, on and on it goes. His pastries have been perfect, light, flaky,  not overly done with sugary excess, it's just pastries and baking the way it should be. You can't really put it in words. You taste it, you know it. You understand when you bite into his wonderful creations that this is the real thing. 

5 Stars based on repeat visits, and an impression that only gets better with every bite I get of the Chef's wonderful creations. Fresh rye and pumpernickel bread? Apple pies? Buttercream cupcakes? Oh man, I'm looking at moving elsewhere in the Vegas valley but the Chef is making me think twice about leaving Henderson!

The burger was priced at $5.99..

Would have preferred a 8oz size burger, I'm a beef guy and 4oz to 5oz just doesn't do it for me. Asked about a making it a double Juicy Lucy but he said because the cheese is already built in, it doesn't taste good.

Overall the patty tasted ok.. But it was just too small, tasted home-made, fresh, 100% beef. So $5.99 for a cheese burger is not bad for value.  However, I think they should definitely put a bigger size patty option for their signature burger.. Also considering this place is called Big Moe's Burger.. You expect big..

The chef did heat up the bun and it was slightly toasted, but the bun was cold, thick, over-powered the beef, so it ruined the burger for me for.

The food was fine. They were out of figs for the fig/serrano/cheese item (one of our favorites at any tapas place). The taste of the food was fine, though not amazing. Overall a 3-3.5 stars for the food. We did order the mushrooms with snails and couldn't find any snails in our mushrooms. The wine (we ordered a half-bottle) suggestion from the waiter was good and reasonably priced.  This was all good.

Now the not so good... we ordered 7 items. We weren't hugely hungry and were considering dessert, so we erred on the side of caution (they suggest 5-10 per person). As expected, the items were small (they are called pintxos for a reason). Add to this the bread and it was a reasonably sized meal. The problem was with the timing.  I'm not sure if it is because we ordered fewer items than suggested or if they are always this disorganized, but we immediately got 2 of our tapas. The others came sporadically, often with a 15+ minute wait in between. At one point, they cleared our plates and eventually brought us new ones. However, we waited 30+ minutes for our last two tapas... that then came at the same time. During this time, waiters/servers passed through (checking for used plates??), but didn't stop, didn't ask if we'd like anything... eventually my husband had to stop our waiter to make sure that they were going to bring the rest. It had been so long we were assuming that they had forgotten.  Communication would have been appreciated.

All in all... we decided not to have dessert here - who knew how long we'd be waiting! And, unfortunately, we've decided not to return to Pintxos the next time we are in town. While the food is solid and typically an interesting mix, the service left a lot to be desired.",0,9Purj2RpH-q-t4mqCesapA

Overall- Try these things:
-Crab legs:  Diamond and 7 star members can ask for a plate of steamed crab for their table. When I say plate... It's more like a tray filled with crab goodness. Nice if you have a big group!
-Meatballs: CRAP (not in a bad way), they were good! I'm not normally an Italian eater, but I couldn't resist and was also tempted by the Fresh pepperoni pizza- another yummy choice btw.
-Berry salad with lemon cream. Might sound strange, but the lemon flavor is very faint. It was more sweet than sour!
-Meat: O glorious meat. I ate a lot of prime rib. And ribs. And... everything at the carving station for that matter. The prime rib was the best of the bunch.
-Salad and desserts: Not as memorable as other buffets.

My iPhone had a cracked screen and didn't turn on and my boyfriends phone had water damage. They said that we could pick up the phones the next day. Next day went to pick up the phones and they seemed fine. They both turned on and had new screens. My iPhone screen was coming off and they told me to just get a snug case. I had been a whole 24 hours without a phone so I could care less about it at that time. A couple days went by and my phones screen wouldn't turn work or it would call people randomly. Part of the phone didn't respond to the touch screen. My boyfriends phone turned off and wouldn't turn on again. We brought the phones back and they said they would take a look at it. They called me to tell me my phones were ready (me thinking that they had fixed both) I went to pick them up and they said they had fixed my iPhone but they need more time with the Galaxy.

I immediately went to the shop and got my full refund after they took a total of 7 days looking over my phone. My iPhone still acts up with the touch screen but oh well.

When it changed to Planet Hollywood, I ate here for a family reunion dinner and it was decent, it was better back then.  So, we tried it out once more during our most recent adventure to Vegas.

First off, $27.99 per adult for dinner, on a Monday?  That's Redonkulous with a capital ""R.""  Thankfully, I'm not complaining much because I got a BOGO coupon so technically, for the s/o and I, it was only $14 each.

The buffet offerings were just okay.  Sure, they had crab salad and shrimp cocktail served in martini glasses but don't be fooled by it, it's not better quality, it's called perception.  They also had the usual Asian, Italian, American, Mediterranean and Seafood fare.  BTW, is it just me or do my fellow Asians act like savages when it comes to Crab Legs?  It's not like it's going to run out people, there's more where it came from, geez!  The salad bar, which was separated in opposite ends of the buffet had to be the sorriest salad bar I've ever experienced, even my hometown pizza parlor offers more salad toppings than this buffet!  But in the end, how can you be mad when they serve up fresh Cotton Candy?  Thankfully they put it high enough so the kiddies don't snatch it all up or get their cooties all over them. :)

Overall, if I had paid full price, The Spice Market Buffet would've gotten 2-stars, no doubt.  But since I didn't, in my opinion, it was worth 3-stars.

PS - Want a BOGO coupon too?  Just check in to Planet Hollywood on FourSquare, show your phone to the Rewards desk located near the bar and they'll give you your coupon.  Not sure how long this promo will last though.",2,-vBbg7fTK3y8W0PtpzlLWQ

There are only 3 items on the menu (the cheesecake ($12), the honey madeleine cupcake ($2.50) and the cheesecake biscotti ($4.80)). The cheesecake was delicious, fluffy and light. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was perfect. The honey madeleine was only good when it was fresh out of the oven. After a few hours it was really dry and hardened up. The cheesecake biscotti were really good as well. 

On my last day in Montreal, I wanted to buy multiple cheesecakes back to NY for family and friends but they have a very strict one cheesecake per person rule. I thought this was ridiculous since the hype have died down in the area and there was no one on line! It was my money that's going down the drain so I didn't see what the big deal of selling me 2 extra cheesecakes would do to them. I also wish there were different cheesecake flavors besides the original.

I came in to browse and find something for summer reading but was dismayed by the usual displays of books labeled as beach reads and the same stuff found on the first page of any reading list for the summer.
 I wandered about searching for an ""employee recommendations"" display, a typical fixture in most book stores, but found none. 
I inquired the help desk regarding a recommendation because nothing had caught my eye and got the longest blank stare followed by stutters. 
So I asked, ""Well what are you reading now?"" 
Blank stare. 
""Okay... Have you come across anything good lately?""
Blank stare. 
""Nevermind.""
 I turned and went to exit the store, grumbling about how Barnes & Noble was the only book store to hire employees who do not read or cannot fake review a book (a skill acquired by readers and nonreaders alike during high school lit classes). A shorter woman came rushing up to me apologizing that she heard my exchange but could not come save me in time and pointed out three titles she read recently and urging me to read one of them, giving several convincing reasons of its worth. 
If I could remember her name I would call and tell the manager to give her a raise. She was that kind, helpful, and well-read. 

This Barnes & Noble is a book store for coffee drinkers, with a larger music and movie section than books.  The employees are rarely helpful (based upon experience of past five years) and make me long for the days of Borders.",1,atjvpxA1AITWnV_Qa8QWQA

First annoyance: Closed Sundays and many non-standard restaurant closing days during the year.  Since, I don't work in that area anymore I can only go there evenings and weekends.  I can't recall how many times I craved this place after a round of golf.

Second annoyance: I don't think I've been able to have their doubles for over a year now.  Why? Because they NEVER have any (it seems) outside the hours of 12-5pm.  I would go there after work time after time and no doubles every time.  And it's not like they won't be able to sell them.  Many people come in after me between 7-9 and ask for doubles.

Third annoyance: Their portion size for their Oxtail dinner has gone WAYYY down.  It was my favourite thing to get but after the last time when I got TWO PIECES (literally), I don't want to get it anymore.  I don't get full from it and it's the most expensive thing on their menu ~$7.50.

Those are the major annoyances so here is the good stuff.  The food is made fresh.  The rotis are spiced really nice and tasty.  Their oxtail is my favourite meat there.  I really like how their gravy is not ""goupy"" like like other places.  Its thin like a jus.

The frys were very tasty and not the typical frys you get at a fast food restaurant .  The only reason I gave 4 stars is there was way too much salt on the frys.  MAKE SURE TO TELL THEM LIGHT SALT and you will give them 5 stars for sure.

What a hidden gem! I've driven by this location numerous times and never thought to drop in but I sure am I glad I did today!

Wow wow wow. Honestly, I didn't expect such a high quality gourmet salad. (I got the berry salad with blue cheese, grilled chicken and almonds) it was delightful. The berries were fresh and plentiful. Not haphazardly thrown in just for color... A true generous amount. And the dressing tasted homemade and was a perfect blend of sweet, tart and savory. I also got the stuffed pepper soup which was so hearty but not gross-greasy if you know what I mean. Very flavorful. I ate every last morsel.

A lady with a cast on her leg was asked by another customer if she could take her food to her table for her....because certainly no employee offered to do so.

We had a dinner and were able to reserve tables for my group. They were very easy to work with and even let us set out decorations and bring our own cake!! Some places don't let you bring outside food in - so it was so great that they let us bring our own cake because it was custom made and beautiful. OHSO has the best mojitos I have ever had.

After properly saucing up at the bar inside Sunset Station, we met up with another friend (she's Thai if you care to know and her last name is stupid hard to pronounce. Somebody needs to marry her just so she can relieve the arthritis in her hand from writing it down so often.) Whatevs.

When we were walking in the lady who was tasked with all of the power in the world to control the flow of the line starting barking out commands like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket and I have to say, most things Donald Trump says about women are most likely true about her.

My companion noted that it looked like storms were on the horizon, so the dude at the table told us we could pay for two people and he'd let three in. Boom. I'm already making money.

Okay, now we're in. Dozens upon dozens of food trucks with everything ranging from ""The Jay-Z of BBQ"" to Cousins Maine Lobster. How could he possibly resist being here?

We took a stroll around, checked out all of the trucks and decided on BBQ. Some dude in flip flops with less than manicured toes sold us on the tri-tip nachos and then like the wrath of 27 angry water gods the heavens opened upon us and rained the tears of a thousand lonely babies. We didn't have our tri-tip nachos that day. Instead, we stood under the beer tent washing away our sorrows while the rain washed away our foodie fest dreams.

No Grigg* sighting, only rib biting..... And that's only because we decided to ditch loserville and go into the Sunset Station cafe for some prime rib. (More like ""subprime"" rib, but that's another review.)

Tried this place today, and got here at about 5:00 pm. I was the only one here.

1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.

2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.

3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty ""well to moderately fleshed"".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....

4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.

6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.

7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.

Overall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds. Compared to In and Out of Five guys, there is no comparison, however, it is certainly edible.  Hey, if you need 500 wings, this is the place to try.",1,owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g

B. Arrowhead- Closest one to us, but ALWAYS a clusterfuck!
C. Avondale- Close, but had never been, so it would be the first time at this one.

We went with Avondale and I was glad we did!

We got there pretty early after opening which was nice.  We got a parking spot right next to the entrance, and had free roam throughout the store before the crowds started to pile up.  If you have been to any Costco, you know the type of stuff they carry.  We picked up our usual supplies, and were in and out within about 30 minutes.  Greeter at the door was incredibly friendly, as well as the boxer/cashier.  I can't remember a time where I had a less stress free experience at Costco.

We planned a wedding in Vegas and the dinner afterwards was for my wife and I,the best man/brides maid an a spouse.
We got there a little early and had a seat at the bar, I asked the bartender what she recommended and she asked me if I was looking for something sweet, An I told her that I was more of a savory taste kind of guy. That is when she recommended a gin based basil infused rock candy drink with cucumber juice, If it wasn't for the fact that it was fifteen dollars I would have ordered 15 more.
Then out of no where some young lady called to me by first name an told us that are table was ready.
We got to are table and that's when the first hiccup happen, We sat there for about 15 mins before someone came to the table to even greet us, An it wasn't even are waiter.
So I figured are guy was busy and I let it slide
When are guy did arrive he gave us that stupid little Ipad so we could order drinks...An then told us that the meat cart was being used and it would be awhile before he could get it, because ""seeing the meat may make you change your mind on what you are going to order""
Well really it didn't..but we had to wait, cause the guy just diapered.
When he did get back it was probably another 20 mins....
So 35 mins later we now had the chance to order but not before the 10 min speech of what kind of meat was on this cart.
So anyway......
Well having been in the industry I told my table to order everything that they wanted an let them send it out when it was needed.(that in itself is a gamble but I didn't not want to wait another 25 mins just to get an app)
So having placed our entire order some 20 mins later my soup an app came out at the same time as did for the rest of my table. With my waiter no where to be found.
then some 30 seconds later my waiter did arrive an lean over to me an apologizes for the double dip saying that it was only suppose to be the soups that arrived...We are pretty low drama kind of people so I said no worries but it still kind a pissed us off.
So after we all finished our soups and moved to are app, we placed are pretty big size soup bowls in the middle of the table and their they sat foooorrrrrrreeeevvvvvvvrrrrrr 
An when we all finished are apps.....Those plates sat in front of us....fooooorrrreeevvvvrrrrr..... So I don't know if it was busy in the back...Maybe are guy was new but no service then over service, kind stunk.
I ordered
1)Asparagus soup
dungeness crab, parmesan custard, pickled white asparagus, smoked salmon caviar... The asparagus was green so I couldn't figure out where it was suppose to be white..but let me tell you this was by far the best thing that ate this night.
2)Smoked Beef Tartare
lemon zest, red onion, capers, guinness infused mustard seeds, yukon gold herb chips... The presentation was amazing because it comes in this smoke filled glass dome and they open table side. If you don't like capers stay away it was a bit over powering and with the home made chips the extra salt is almost an over kill.
3)Roasted Beef Wellington
I mean what can I say, This is the dish that has made this guys career, It was everything that I hoped it to be an then some.
4)Mac & Cheese
blue, cheddar, parmesan, truffle, This was simple amazing. It comes in a small stainless steel kettle and more them likely you will have enough to take home.
5)Melon sorbet (maybe) My best man ordered the bread pudding that everyone is raving about so I went another route for 2 reasons. I just ate enough to kill a horse and knew that a bread pudding was going to be to heavy and...also giving the table a chance to see something different. An I was right, The bread pudding only got eaten 1/3 of the way an ended up in a box.
The sorbet was perfect,light,creamy,and a very very good pallet cleanser from the crab and the wellington.
The one redemption that I will give them is they over heard us talking about the wedding and when the sorbet arrived on the chocolate wafer read ""Congratulations""  An they presented it to my wife, It was a nice touch and good catch by our waiter so I kind of let him off the hook on the hiccups.
With all that being said it's Gordon Ramsay and it was amazing!
We dropped a good buck that night  but I would do it all over again,having never been to a place owned by my idol.
If your there and don't mind spending...Go you won't regret it. hopefully the service will work itself out in the coming months because I do see that it is a issue in most of the posts.
Now only if I could have heard him screaming ""It's bloody raw you ass""
That would have made my night.

Starting with the fries, their crushed potatoes are amazing, the sweet potato fries are perfect as well. The cheese curds are truly squeaky and attention is made that they don't melt in the gravy. In few words you can experience quality classical poutine in Poutineville. Besides that you can make your own poutine, which the patrons seem to be excited about. In addition to the standard menu you will be given sheet with all the ingredients you can pick and concoct your meal. I'm generally happy to have that option, but this is also a risky approach towards your food,  you may end up mixing ingredients you love separately that just don't fit together. This was the experience of my first visit and since then I have learned my lesson not to experiment too much.  I would definitely recommend to Montreal visitors from abroad to go with a standard combination from the menu if this is their first time trying the dish. Otherwise service is quick and efficient. The guys will feed you, make you pay your bill timely and rush the next customers in as sometimes Poutineville gets busy. Have fun!",1,Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug

I've ordered from JT's on about 12 occasions and haven't been disappointed, so I'll just give a quick rundown on the standouts:

Pita - The bread is great and toasted well, buttery and crisp.
Tzatziki - Likely they best I've had from a gyro shop.
Gryo - Great, fresh produce. Green leaf lettuce, tasty and never limp tomatoes, onions, etc.
Kifta Kebab - Fantastic, the best I've had from this category of restaurant in the valley.
Rice - The rice is always tasty, it's cooked and seasoned perfectly with a little dash of smoked paprika to finish
Fries - Some of the yelp reviewers pan them, others love them; I'm in the love camp.  Always crispy never greasy in my experience.
Service - JT is a friendly guy and the one time they made a slight mistake with my order, he corrected it quickly, gave me a discount and comped a drink and some baklava.
Cleanliness - this joint is spotless, as proven by their county inspection record.

Skip the Greek Pita, the Pita Jungle and the other chains, the food here is far tastier and more consistent.  This is my second favorite kebab (gyro) joint in the valley.",1,Rttywvumr25Tldh4Ln7Udw

Okay, perhaps not a virgin per say, but a novice, a newbie, perhaps a beginner wanting to migrate to intermediate. Primers, different brushes for different areas, strobe, pinch pots, bb creme vs foundation, wth? 
I'm pretty simple with the whole make up game, but do occasionally fantasize that I could put on make up and not look a french prostitute, and even though the talented make up artists at Mac know a thing or two about beautifying oneself through make up application, I often don't love the finished look of my painted up face. I must say though this last time, Christina was very skilled in the whole make up process. 
Having brought a friend in who is newly divorced and even less adept in make up than myself, I was so excited to see her all gussied up, fake lashes and all. 
I purchased a few items, will try them out, and as they say, practice makes perfect. 
Mac is a little pricey, but I do think some of their products are worth it. I have read they don't test on animals anymore, which is a good thing, I try to only buy products from companies that don't. Testing on furry friends is not cool.

Let's talk about the appearance first, it's relatively small restaurant, in a basement. Dress warmly if it's cold outside, as it's a bit frisky inside the restaurant. Minimal decoration but cozy and clean. 

Now about the food, the appetizers were very good, from the soup to the eggplant, to the warm bread they bring when u come in. Tasted better than in other restaurant i have  been. As for the main dish (kababs). The sour fillet mignon wasn't that great, I wouldn't recommend it. But the normal fillet mignon and the ground beef were good, very tasty. The rice however was overcooked and a bit smokey. I had only a spoonful of rice. Persian basmati rice is long grained and fluffy this was far from that.

The place has an awesome beer selection, they advertise 50 on tap and I am sure it is close to that (although a few of them were out).  The beers are mostly European ones, with only a couple of Ontario microbrews but the options they have are great, and none of them are Molson or Labatt swill which earns brownie points in my book!  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful and she knew a lot about the beers and was able to offer good suggestions.   

There were no problems on the food side either, I had mussels and spicy sausage which were really tasty while everyone else had something they enjoyed as well.

I'd drive through here for dinner or make the trip though I live a ways away haha. I brought some coworkers here and it's become a favorite lunch spot as we work near by on the strip for 20.95.

Sakana has almost ruined me for other sushi spots, with the exception of Neko, which I suspect is under the same ownership/ management, overall very similar rolls. Their sauce combinations and spiciness have left me a bit unsatisfied, as if their ingredients are missing, from other places.

This little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition, one of the best. They usually have a wait but I've never waited too long whether I sit with coworkers at lunch or I sit at the bar, chefs are quick too. The roll and appetizer variety is plentiful, they offer exclusive dinner menu specials which is totally worth the dinner price. They offer a good selection of rice less rolls and options.

pizza:
loved the pizza here! our normal pizza that we order is the hawaiian pizza and we added bell peppers and sun dried tomatoes. i was impressed with the homemade crust and the fresh toppings. the sauce & crust was delectable.

the bar is wine & beer only:
the server gave us sample a papago beer called orange blossom and it tasted like a creamsicle or a cream soda. my taste buds were so confused..is it dessert or beer? it's unique tasting. anyways we ended up with a blue moon for the mister and pinot grigio for me.

atmosphere:
when we walked in it was jammed packed with tukee locals.  families, couples and older folks enjoying some conversation and pizza. noise level was was a bit loud, but it didn't bother me. the place was packed and made for a fun atmosphere.

prices:
the price for the pizza is a bit on the higher side but so darn tasty. i would say the beer and wine are average prices.

My husband ordered the ribeye and lobster with bread sticks. His came out medium-well and no bread sticks.  We had other food but that was great! These were the problems. 

The waitress (which was awesome) didn't bring out the steaks. The person that did, didn't wait to see if our steaks were to our liking and both of them were wrong. My husband also asked if the bread sticks were coming out and the guy said he would check. Never saw him again. We had our 2 month old with us (first outing with baby) so we didn't want to send the steaks back and wait for fear baby would wake at some point and disrupt the restaurant. So, I ate the part of my steak I could and my husband who is definitely a red meat eater suffered through his over cooked meal. The waitress came back around and asked if all was good and my husband explained the situation.  She said she would get right on the bread sticks. At this point we were almost finished and didn't need the bread. 

She came back to the table said she checked what she put in the computer to make sure she hadn't made a mistake and the bread would be right out. My husband told her we didn't need it now. She said she would take it off the bill and we could take it home and she would send the manager to the table. 

This is why this gets 4 stars. Kim (I hope that was her name), the manager, is amazing. Although, she was really busy doing other things she really took her time with us.

In my 3 visits, I've waited no less than 45 minutes per appointment, despite arriving early.  I think in the 5 hours I've spent here, 10 minutes have been with the doctor.  The facility itself looks like it was built 40 years ago and never renovated.  Some rooms I've met staff in didn't even have lights on; not exactly a pristine and bright medical facility. 

On my new patient forms I marked a cancer history twice, but the doctor seemed surprised when I asked for an oncologist recommendation.  The doctor also ordered blood work analysis on my behalf, said ""here's the blood work analysis information you requested!"", and gave me a 20 page ""book"" of things I could have read online. I have no idea how much this cost, but it's not worth the paper it's printed on. The doctor also recommended I go outside to get more sun, saying it might ""improve my mood"".  While getting my temperature taken, the nurse said ""oh, this isn't working, I don't quite know why, do you have a fever?""

I could go on, but I think you get the point. Facilities are dated, the entire operation is unprofessional, and you should be very careful with what you ask for here.",5,JXJ9C0fAUgTnU1bDrJCw2g

In 2012, my boyfriend bought a 1995 Jeep.  It wasn't without its problems, and we knew that when we bought it.  The engine ended up going out a couple of months after we bought it.  We didn't have the funds for a new car (which is why we had 95 in the first place), but we did have credit cards and we needed the second vehicle.  So, for Christmas, I decided to be sneaky and get the engine replaced.

Hefty quoted me the lowest price of anyone.  I took it in, it was ready to go within a few days, and it was the best Christmas present ever.  Fast forward two months.  The tranny drops (it had shown NO signs of transmission trouble AT ALL before the new engine got put in...is it Hefty's fault?  Can't say for sure) and again, we need the second car running.  We shell out another thousand+ dollars.  A month after that, the transmission starts slipping.  We take it in...we do, after all, have a warranty.  They fix it, but not really.  It just seems to slip LESS. But, to be honest, we just figured the car was a lemon and didn't blame Hefty...until our most recent experience.  

We now own an 05 SUV.  Not the newest car, but it ran PERFECTLY when we bought it.  Unfortunately, the previous owners didn't treat it very well and a head gasket blew due to corrosion after about five months of ownership.  It showed no signs of a head gasket blowing out until it happened.  No check engine light.  Our oil pressure was fine.  The oil wasn't milky.  There was no leakage that was visible to the naked eye.  There was no smoke.  It idled like a champ and drove like one, too.  Again, THIS CAR RAN PERFECTLY.  Then we stopped to get gas on a trip, the car wouldn't start back up, watery oil was coming out of the catalytic converter accompanied by white smoke out of the muffler.  Great.  Since we had what we THOUGHT was a good and fairly priced experience with Hefty before, we took it in to them to have the head gasket repair done.  BIG MISTAKE.

$1600 later we have a vehicle that runs MUCH WORSE than it did prior to the repair.  The check engine light is always on and reads out as a random misfire. The car idles ROUGH to the point that it's uncomfortable, and you can feel it misfire while you're driving.  Now we KNOW that Hefty is what was wrong with our Jeep, since this car ran great prior to them ""repairing"" it.  We're now taking it to another mechanic, who we trust.

tl;dr AVOID HEFTY AT ALL COSTS",2,ByVNS6P4ENaZ8eJU-1fgrA

I went inside first and while waiting to give my order, I heard some people say to the server that they'd be on the patio.  I asked her if I just go there and take a seat and she said yes. 

I went outside and I had my pick of several tables.  The good sized patio area was well covered by umbrellas so the sun was not a problem.  There is a small view of the Strip.  You can see the tops of the taller hotels over the detention basin across Rainbow Boulevard.

In a brief time, the server came out and took my order.  Since I had looked at the menu while waiting inside, I was ready to order.  I started out with lentil soup and followed this up with their chicken pesto panini.  I also got a caramel cappuccino. 

The soup was very good.  Hearty amounts of small chopped vegetables and lentils.  The panini was very good.  The menu describes it as: Grilled chicken with melted provolone, ripe tomatoes, crispy bacon and spinach--drizzled with pesto spread.  That's a good description.

Service was very good.  My server was also a very pleasant woman.  The only thing about which they have no control over is the noise from Rainbow Boulevard.  Being a major street and with a number of trucks, it was quite loud at times.  That won't dissuade me from returning when the weather is good for patio dining.",18,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

The place was very clean and the people working there were attentive to getting plates off the table and such but the food was mediocre at best.  There was not any one food that was excellent.  It was like eating at Golden Corral (better fried fish) at double the price. Even the prime rib was not very good. I think I only enjoyed the desert, the cannoli was kind of a fun surprise.

The menu is interesting in that this is a japanese fusion place so they have everything from ramen to waffles with bulgogi, I like interesting, hence the excitement, unfortunately where it really mattered they were lacking.
We started with the braised pork belly slices, I was so excited and consequently somewhat let down. The flavor was good, not great but good, I prefer my pork belly a little crisp, here, the meat was soooo tender you can barely pick it up.. there was sauce and meat chucks everywhere.. lol I thought it was just me but noted that several others who tried the dish also had the same issue. 
I finished with sesame tonk ramen and this is where my sadness really crept in. I like my ramen savory, hot and tasty.. here it was... bleh, warm and needed more flavor. The seaweed while good overwhelmed the dish which was disappointing because that is primarily all I could taste.

We were sad to discover the Vegetarian Menu was actually a Vegan / Gluten Free Menu & most of the dishes didn't float our boats.  Just because we don't eat meat, it doesn't mean we only want fruit for dessert or no cheese / cream / pasta offerings for entrees....so the tasting menu was out for 2 of the 3 veggies & we chose a la carte

Beet & mushroom salad - this was cold salad & was pretty tasty

Main was the whole tomato stuffed w/ a curried rice - no wow factor & ended up giving over 3/4 of my dish to BF

Meaty bunch in our group got the Foie Gras w/ Porcini & the foie & shrooms were cut in identical chunks & all cooked together so the flavors could compliment.  Eye rolls from the deliciousness

Mains included Venison & Steak & the portions were extremely small.  The venison was overcooked although requested to be med rare & the steak was dry but expected since Buddy #1 ordered it med-well.

There was an Intermezzo course of Blue Moon foam & Roquefort w/ poached Pears that was a major miss - very little cheese & way too tart.  The Vegan Menu Intermezzo was a Raspberry Sorbet & it was just a standard sorbet

Started dinner at 8:30pm & it was after 11:30pm when half of our table cried uncle & had to leave - timing between dishes was excruciatingly long & especially for those of us not enjoying the tasting menu - we left before the dessert course was served but were filled in the next day that this was a ginormous course that was basically 3 whole desserts.  There was supposed to be a tasting of 6 desserts but we were told that each of the 6 was like 1/2 of 1 entire dessert.....maybe we should have stayed  :-)

Jim was very responsive to our phone calls and arranged to come to our house in a reasonable time frame. We had given him a pretty specific list of exactly what we were wanting to install, though our list was really just from a pre-made package at a competing security company. After walking through the house with me and asking questions, Jim was quick to help me understand that what we were asking for probably wouldn't work as well for our home. We were wanting a couple of motion sensors, but Jim realized that we have a cat who likes to jump up and lounge on the tops of our furniture. He pointed out that, while the sensors wouldn't always mistake the cat for an intruder, our same objectives could be accomplished for the same price by increasing the door/window sensors and utilizing glass-break detectors. Overall, we put sensors on each door and window and installed two glass-break detectors for a very reasonable price. The competitor from whom we obtained the pre-made security package offered us a price $2 lower per month than JPG, but we ultimately went with JPG because it seemed Jim's company actually cared about what their customers really needed.

At no time did Jim or his installer mention my needing to leave a review for them. I do so because we've had a great experience; I've already recommended JPG to a neighbor and close friends of mine.",0,IG604iFVONjEpz4I6s1OMg

He seemed nice at the time.  I called a few hours before my appt. because the weather was really rough outside and I was not sure if they would stay open and/or I would have trouble on the roads.  I spoke with Matt again and he had a bit of an attitude.  I brushed it off thinking maybe others are calling with the same issue.  I arrived 10 minutes early for my appt. and when it was 10 minutes after my appt. time, I asked the receptionist what the delay was and she said it should only be a few more minutes.  I asked where Matt was and she said he was gone for the day.  She could tell I was a bit put off having to wait past my scheduled time. 

Well....the esthetician was 30 minutes behind which really put me in a bind because I had to get to work (which I ended up being late for).

The facial experience itself was horrible.  First - the room is very, very small and the table is 3' high.  I am on the shorter side and had to get a chair to use to get onto the bed.  There was no dimmer in the room so the light overhead was very bright.  The esthetician mentioned she had only been working there four weeks and she asked for a lamp but never got one.  She proceeds with the facial and after a bit of cleansing she applied an ""acid"" mask.  I have never heard of such a thing and it literally felt like my face was on fire.  The burn was unbearable and I did my best to stay calm and ask for it to be removed from my face.  It took about 20 minutes for my face to cool off (she did apply an oatmeal mask afterwards that was a little gentler).  Parts of my face the following morning were actually pealing. 

I've been getting facials for over ten years and never had such a horrific experience.

When I went to check out I wanted to use a credit card for the tip.  The receptionist said she had to charge money ($.01) first before she could ring it up.  I found that to be odd since a lot of merchants these days' use square or something of the like and it never charges you a small amount before you can process the actual charge.  

While reviews are certainly subjective, I cannot sugar coat this one.  It is what it is and my experience was a bit of a nightmare.  Live and Learn!",3,rCZuR2ipj0DUwmHMz1Z1QA

And sadly, that was the best part of the meal. The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle with no smile, short answers, and not friendly at all. She wasn't unfriendly, just like I said...a wet noodle. 

The chips and ""salsa"" came. We tried the hot, but the waitress was right in calling it smooth. It was blended, had little flavor, and was literally and figuratively cold. As if it was in a fridge. The regular salsa had little flavor as well.

Then came the menu which was set up nice until I saw the prices and the size. The prices were easily half again as most places with portions half the size of the better and cheaper restaurants. 

We got a ""bean and jalapeño"" dip that had no flavor whatsoever. We mixed in the ""hot"" sauce in an attempt to salvage it. It got a little better. 

So I ordered my usual go to at a new Mexican restaurant. Flautas with refried beans and rice. The rice was ok. The beans actually had good flavor, but the tiny little flautas were bad to the point of I just stopped eating anything all together. 

Then on top, they over charged me!

We ordered garlic knots, drinks, and 2 breakfast pizzas (one veggie & one meat lovers). We were disappointed that ""breakfast"" doesn't include coffee, but whatever.

The breakfast pizzas were pretty delicious. The crust was thick and crispy with great flavor. The one with meat had generous amounts of ham, bacon, sausage, egg...it was fantastic. The veggie one had peppers, onions, spinach, tomato. Basically an amazing omelette pizza mash up.

The Pecan Chelsea was excellent.

The butter tarts -- pecan or chocolate pecan -- tasted weird to me. My sister said they tasted like they had dish soap in them. I don't think it's that they were poorly made, just that they seem to be using a non-standard recipe. Not sure what the reason for this is; why mess 
with perfection?

If not for the weak butter tarts this would be a 4 star place.

The dumplings, or soup buns whichever english translation you prefer are the highlight of the food that they offer. That is the better dishes that they serve. as it is just right, and not too salty or oily. The duck although cooked to just the right temperature and right texture, was too salty. and the cold dish in the bamboo shoots was the same. The food would've been worth a 3 or even 3.5 stars. however the service was so terrible it dropped them to a solid 2 star. 

The servers are not just rude, but also can't process orders. We had to ask 3 servers for a spoon, before we gave up and just grabbed one ourselves off a vacant table. Also the dishes they provided were dirty to start. Normally i take chinese restaurant services with a grain of salt. but this one was beyond terrible, because not just one bad server., but all their servers were bad. And to add on this is a very small restaurant that doesn't seat a lot of people. Yet they still managed to have bad service, as it was not because their too busy or other factors.  For all the gruff you would take from the servers, i would say it does not make it worth it to go to this restaurant to eat.

I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place. 

The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more.",5,v6J_GeMsl6XTT-ZsV6ApHA

I called this vet because I had a friend recommend this place. I made an appointment and brought him in the following day and upon arrival I could tell my scheduled time was double booked. The gentleman who helped me seemed in a hurry and took my dog right back came out a few seconds later saying my dog was fine and whatever it was must of cleared up. He handed me my leash and said no charge!! I found that to be unsettling but assumed he thoroughly checked my dog quickly and I took his professional word for it. He was wrong! The following day this being a Saturday now my dog did the same thing screaming in pain now trying to have a bowel movement unsuccessfully. At that time the vet was closed so the poor guy went on like this all night Saturday and all day Sunday! He even started to pee blood!! I finally get him back to the vet I figured everyone has a busy day I'll give them another shot. They found out my dog had a bad prostate infection and needed to be neutered. We did that and it went well and I got some going home instructions that said to bring him in in two weeks and that visit was covered under the original charge. Two weeks pass I take him for his follow up. He had diarrhea following the surgery so I mentioned that and in mentioning that without a examination of any kind they brought some pills in and charged me $120 for just mentioning my dog had diarrhea. I looked up the price of the pills on 1800 pet meds it was about $45 in pills so it cost me $75 to mention my dog had diarrhea no examination no nothing.

Each of us tried a fruit chia (pictured): mango and lichee, diluting the sweetness with ice water.

The green papaya with tender calamari was very good, the fried chicken wings in garlic butter even better (not notably garlicky). Best of all was the crispy rice noodle with beef and vegetables. It is in my experience rare to find crispy rice noodles on menus of American Vietnamese restaurants, and I love it!

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink/stove/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains/shades
- washer/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots/pans/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",6,tCfKY7zsd4a5JKTEoFQgfQ

Kristy was more interested in sitting down and talking with some guy at another table, than serving customers during dinner rush.

The scrambled eggs were soft fluffy pillows of delicious goodness! This has got to be the best scrambled eggs I've eaten my entire life, by a mile! The lightness of the eggs is almost unreal. The rest of the skillet was quite fantastic too.. They slice their potatoes real thin, so they end up being super crisp. The chorizo was quite fantastic as well and was a really good addition to the already amazing food. I tried the other skillet and banana cream pancakes; and needless to mention, they also knocked it out of the park in the taste department. 

I have never been big on pancakes but these pancakes are something else altogether! Incredibly soft with just a touch of crisp. Absolutely divine! The food here is nothing short of ambrosia. I have heard a great deal about their freshly squeezed orange juice but to be quite honest, I wanted to save up room to stuff my face with as much food as I possibly could. By far, my favorite brunch food in Arizona!",3,NiJmVx6JPcAUoE3d4j9aVg

I did my research on the company and did see a couple negative reviews but thought they might be a ""one off"" experience or hard to please customers.  The price was great and about $100 less than the other companies.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  Only ONE bellhop showed up for the job.  The company called me multiple times and said that they were sending someone else while the ONE guy was moving everything out of my building. Eventually another Bellhop did show up..for about 45 minutes.. rushed and stressed me out even more and when I got the bill I saw they charged me for him being there for two hours.

The ONE bellhop that was there from the beginning had one more run to make.  He had dragged my mattress out in the hall way of my apartment building and said he would be right back. When the mover didn't come back after an hour I went to look for him.  The mover and the truck driver were NO WHERE in sight.  My furniture was sitting out on a VERY BUSY road with the truck door open.  The ONE bellhop that showed up JUST UP AND LEFT. My mother and I had to drag my mattress back inside of my apartment and I had to sit outside to make sure no one was stealing literally all of my belongings. During the lull of...an hour..hour and a half...of not knowing where the truck driver was and realizing that the mover just BAILED an ambulance showed up at my apartment building and the truck was blocking the cop and paramedics from the easiest access to the patient. 

Eventually about two hours later the company sent two more bellhops out and they were able to finally finish the job.  It took the company 10 hours to move out of a 600 sq ft studio. The truck was loaded terribly and it looked like the boxes marked fragile were purposely thrown around..they were dented and some of the belongings inside were broken. 

The company charged me for 10 hours of bellhops and 10 hours of moving.  At first they told me they would take off the price of the truck....I refuse to pay for 10 hours of moving when it should have taken three hours AT MOST.  It was not my fault that the company has unreliable employees.  After multiple phone calls and added stress by bill was ""discounted"" and ended up paying way too much for this NIGHTMARE of a move.  

Honestly just look through the reviews...every other review shows an issue or a bell hop not showing up.  Please learn from my experience and hire a different moving company.  It was not worth saving $100 for all the stress and headache I went through.",4,lNCYyiMnTzvA-HY-nFQKLQ

I just ordered my first take-out order from Dragon Pearl, and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed. The dumplings seem to be their specialty but I found them to be a bit too doughy for my liking. People raved about their salt and pepper squid, but mine was over-cooked and the batter to has too much egg and not enough crisp. I carried that container of squid for (maybe) two minutes before I ate it, so it's not because it  was sitting in a closed container for too long.

Stepping into the restaurant on a Wednesday night, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't overly crowded, especially at the bar where we had requested seats.

After our first cocktails (the refreshing and fruit filled Sake Sangria), we embarked on the tasting menu with the regular drink pairing. 

The first item sent to us was a Hamachi and miso amuse-bouche, in a Dashi tea. The small dish was delicate and sweet, the miso not at all overpowering. 

Next, the sashimi"" platter arrived, an elegant tile covered in wonderful confections, including a standout Chicken Sashimi. For those worried, the chicken is cured, not raw, and absolutely mouthwatering. Equally delicious, the Conch in stock practically defined the word ""Umami"". Less impressive, the Edamame mousse - which tasted bland and sticky - and the Shrimp jello, which consisted of an over-cooked shrimp in a cold gelatinous casing.

Our next course was presented with a flourish of smoke and drama - a ""Dashissoise"" playing both on the idea of classic French cold soup, and, well, Corned Beef. It was, for lack of a better description, effing yummy.

The fourth course consisted of a lovely ""vegetable garden"", complete with whimsical ""soil"" made out of fried Panko and olive crumbs. That 'Furikake' carried the dish. While winter melon is typically not the best Asian vegetable, the cubed and pickled gourd was crisp and fruity. A helping of fresh green peas certainly improved the vegetable course.

The middle of the meal was upon us, and so was one of the best things I have ever tasted. Chawanmushi, an ordinary egg pudding most Asian families are familiar with, was elevated to a height I had not expected, with the addition of Truffle oil and Grana Padano. It was comfort food turned into rich decadence, with the addition of two simple ingredients.

It was therefore disappointing when next, the Nanban course arrived with a lacklustre soue-vied salmon paired with a boring Harissa sauce. 

Disillusionment did not last for long. The next platter, a play on a very familiar meal of ham, beans and sausage, was covered in a buttery white sauce and cubes of fried Boudin Noir. Creamy blood sausage, pork fat...what's not to love? The cleverness of playing with such familiar ingredients - much like the Chawanmushi - contributed greatly to the enjoyment.

Dessert did provide one last lovely surprise; savoury flavours mixed with sweet (such a sure facet of Asian desserts) was a wonderful way to end the evening. Who knew edamame and chocolate would work so well together?

Aside from the food, the wine pairing throughout the meal was not exactly great. Ontario whites - reeking of bad grapes - did not deserve the foods they were paired with. The one Sake we were served told me that for ten dollars more, the Sake  pairing is probably the way to go in the future.

The clientele ranged from dignified Japanese men savouring every last item, to kids who didn't look up from their smartphones long enough to interact with each other, much less to enjoy the food set before them. 

Ultimately, the bad of this dining experience did not come close to outweighing the good. For the price and the quality, this restaurant is worth revisiting.",2,qyzaP2cbtouoAta3UbQRGg

While eating the Sake Orenji, I had to sit back after a few bites and just close my eyes. It felt like instant meditation. 

The service was also incredible and incredibly friendly. 

We appreciated very much the woman (her name has slipped by, Jo? Possibly?) who came around to inquire on everyone's dining experience. We ended up talking to her forever (which was wonderful) and she told us a lot about the food, the goals of the chef and the staff, and just a lot about what you could tell was tons of heart and care put into every aspect of the operation. 

I truly hope the best for this place and tell everyone I can about eating here! 

I haven't had a dining experience like this in a long time that felt entirely complete and left my tummy and my spirit lifted. I love to see places like this where they really consider the art of food and turn it into an adventure.

The slices were abnormally larger than the already LARGE individual slices so it was really hard to handle the slices. Plates not big enough for slices so a portion the pizza is touching the table. Its not cut all the was thru in the box so you have to recut with your pizza slicer and the box is already soggy from the toppings and sauce so we ended up cutting all the way through the box.

Our server took the time to engage in small-talk, describe the menu, as well as give her recommendations on which flavors complimented which seafood the best. 

We ordered a combo with 1.25lbs Dungeness Crab, 1lbs of shrimp, 1 corn and 1 potato paired with curry. In addition, we ordered 1 lbs of mussels from the happy hour menu. The curry was very savory and absolutely mouthgasmic, not to mention that the price was reasonable as well ($48.95). The mussels ($9.95) were huge and very fresh, but I was not really a fan of the Cajun sauce it was paired with. My only gripe about the whole experience were the drinks that we ordered. The rum & coke + gin & tonic proportions seemed a bit off (too much alcohol). Yea, its great that we were getting more alcohol for the money, but the drinks definitely didn't taste good.

Those darn Bloomin' Onions have me addicted!  Even with my love of Outback, it can't save this particular location for me.  This location just stinks!  

I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.

We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.

Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.  

The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.

I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.

We made reservations for a Thursday night before a long weekend expecting it to be packed. Though not dead either, noise was never an issue. Service was spot on. 

We shared fresh raw oysters and the lobster fritters. Both dishes were amazing. I loved how many accompaniments came with the oysters. I don't love lobster but these little gems were amazing!

For my entree I had the grilled sea bass. Incredible piece of fish. Good sized portion. I loved the sauce it came with - good heat and full flavor. 

On our waiter's recommendation we shared the black truffle cavatelli as one of our sides (though it's on the appy menu). Good flavor but the oils had separated. The grilled asparagus was super fresh.

We ordered wine a la carte. 

We hardly ever eat dessert but couldn't resist the toasted coconut cheesecake bites. Wow... delicious.

Her excuse is she mentioned to us before we paid the bill but it takes time to cook.
We ordered a fried cucumber with eggs , there is no such thing on the menu , but they charged me fried cucumber with shrimp . My questions is where is the shrimp. 
They charge the tips by 18% automatictly on bill and they still asked for the tips.
It is unfortunately experience at Vagas .

I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.

My friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)

I ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.

anyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap.",17,oBYbYmIPe2ny6W99aSMzlA

Seth and his team are very encouraging and the gym as a whole is a VERY positive environment. Everyone respects and encourages one another.

Not only do they bake fresh breads and buns on site, but they also serve Cha Time Bubble Tea in the same location. And to top it off, they also have fresh baguettes. And what's more, it's a Taiwanese chain and full of fancy buns that are not easily found not just in the hood but in the entire GTA! So I think this place has a LOT of potential for greatness. The space is awesome, the vibe is inviting and definitely feels like the kind of place I want in my hood. The only room for improvement is some of the bread are kind of dry. I would definitely suggest they work on that. For example matcha red bean was super dry. But some of the other bread such as the sweet taro bun was moist and lightly sweetened. I also loved the bacon twist bread. It went perfectly with my dinner and I can forsee me buying lots and lots of it in the future. 

Grand opening is on 9/17 but the place was packed when I went on the soft opening earlier in the week. It's currently cash only but hopefully they will setup the machines soon.

In the past a guy name Carter owned (or managed I don't know) this location and his customer service was really great. He was very people oriented and helpful when it came to renting cars and accommodating in terms of the car type preferred. 
HOWEVER NOW this place SUCKS. I rented a car (small SUV) this weekend and upon entering this place which is located through the Sears auto center I was immediately annoyed because there was no one at the counter but I took a deep breathe and thought that maybe the person could be in that restroom (always give hr benefit of a doubt). 
I waited along with my children for about 5 minutes and the young lady walked in with a guy and just looked me up and down and went behind the counter to finish up with the guy which is okay with me he was there with her before I came. I stood behind him to wait in line and once she finished up with him I stepped up only to be presented with a blank stare as I smiled. I mentioned I was here to pick up my reserve vehicle and per protocol and asked for my DL. She gave me a contract and ask me to sign on all the lines I read and said how am I sign I g something to agree to pay for cleaning of stains in a vehicle I haven't seen or inspected. She said Ok I'll show you in a minute can you have a seat. HuH I was here first why am I taking a seat for her to take care of the people who came after me? 
Needless to say I step to the waiting area in view and listening distance from the counter and stood. She checked back in the cars for the two people who were behind me before heading outside and coming back in telling me she checked the vehicle and it's good. I replied okay so I'll take the keys to inspect before signing as I stated. She gave me the keys and immediately as I approached I noticed a dent in the car with paint chipped and upon opening the door I saw stains in that seats so I kindly went back in to inform her and she came out and wrote it up. 
MY QUESTION:
Why did you go out to check the car and come back to say it's perfectly fine when it wasn't?

Hmmm Makes me feel that they are trying to get someone to be held responsible for the crappy cars they have and I'm honestly NOT THE ONE. I'm sure they try often and may succeed but not this here woman you can not fool.",4,XUwYlVRuyoImgtaw8Cjztg

I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said ""hi there"", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said ""hi, 2 please"" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go ""who has that table"" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entrées and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entrées. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entrées wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are.

We took advantage of the Happy Hour drink specials and ordered the $2 margaritas to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.  We also grabbed the $5 appetizer specials and ordered the calamari.  Both were very good, although I prefer my calamari with a marinara sauce (they serve it with a sweet/spicy chili sauce).  For my entree, I ordered the La Torta, and I have to say that I was disappointed with it.  It's basically a grilled chicken sandwich with sliced avocado, but there was no seasoning to it--no salt, pepper, spice or anything. It was very bland.  The beans and rice that came with it were also kind of bland, so I smothered them with salsa.

The service was very prompt and courteous, and our food was delivered to our table promptly.  We really enjoyed the music soundtrack that was playing--a good mix of dance tunes on a great sound system--that was a big plus!  The ambiance was pretty cool, with a lot of leftover features from the former place (Bar Louie's), but now with a Baja vibe.

They had kiosks but only 1-2 were usable at a time. They only had one person behind the counter to process everyone. Almost all the other car rental companies were long lines so I didn't mind this.

Then we returned our car at the cosmopolitan. This was fun. We knew it would close at 5 so we made sure to return at 4:40 or so. There was no one at the counter, and the note said they'd be back by like 4:00. So I was kind of scared that no one would show up and we'd be charged for returning the car too late. Thankfully 10 minutes later a lady shows up and she starts processing the return. We quickly realized she was stoned. She was slurring, and asking the same question multiple times. When she was using the keyboard she had to lean close to look at it. I was amazed that she actually did successfully process our return and gave us a receipt.

It tries hard to stay clean (which it generally does) and please its customers (which it can), but it cannot compete with the nicer stores in the area. In fact, Fry's has a much better competing store a mile away, at Main and Alma School.

The meat section is ok but it doesn't shine when it comes to quality and selection. The deli is questionable at best, and the bakery doesn't stock much. The produce section is typically Fry's, which means you won't find anything special here, and the prices are not fantastic. There is a tiny floral section and a full pharmacy.

The worst part of the store is the parking lot. It's easy to access, but once you're inside, plan on bumping over multiple speed bumps and waiting for several other slow and unmotivated drivers. The store does not police its entrance well, so it's not uncommon for someone to park in the throughway right in front of the entrance. 

They didn't have cart corrals in the parking lot for years, but about a year ago, they took up many, many parking spots with tiny, cheap, poorly made corrals that no one uses anyway. This parking lot is chaos.",1,0k5LIdglqBTmxukDCLnjWA

They have one of those conveyor belts for the sushi if you sit at the bar.  We took a table and ordered off the menu.  We both got bento boxes.

First came the miso soup.  It had a strong flavor, and was salty.  Not my favorite.

The chicken Katsu in the bento was pretty good.  The teriyaki chicken had a sort of charred taste to it.  I didn't really like it.  The ""steak"" strips were almost flavorless.  Yes, they tasted like beef but very weakly.  Kinda strange.  I didn't try the cucumber salad stuff.  My wife likes that sort of thing so I gave it to her.  She seemed to like it.  I did eat the sushi pieces that were included.  Very little flavor there also.  The calamari salad was a pile of calamari on top of a pile of leaves (spinach, I think).  The calamari was cooked properly, not too tough or chewy, and the flavor was fine.

Mixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.

ME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)

SPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.

DESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.

WINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.

SERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)

OVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.

PS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.",1,_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ

When I drove up, I really didn't know what to think. It's in a plaza with a Harris Teeter, and some other random shops. Not to mention there is another Chinese place right next door. 
When we arrived, there was a line out the door! I was shocked... how in the world could this be? two places right by each other and this one has a myriad of hungry folks drooling over the menu while the other sits empty. We gave the hostess our name and headed outside to wait for our name to be called. While you're sitting there, you are teased by a stand with a tray filled with delicious looking goodness. 
Finally our name gets called and we head into the tiny restaurant. I decided on the honey chicken which came in one of those awesome trays with all the compartments I'd seen outside. Sweet! It was only $6.95 so I figured I couldn't go wrong for that.
When she brought me that food, Oh man... was I excited. It had the honey chicken, mixed with veggies and honey shrimp. 2 crab ran goons, a salad & the most amazing rice I've ever had. OK, I know you're thinking... Um, Beth it's just rice. NO!!! You don't understand. I think it has magical powers of delicious proportions. When I tried the first bite of honey chicken, I seriously think the clouds above parted and angels started to sing. 
Most people go for the sushi, and I've gone 3 times with the intentions of trying the sushi, but dang that honey chicken is good, and I can't imagine not having it!!! Everyone I know who's had the sushi has LOVED it though, so it's a high priority in my life to try it. Most of the time I end a review saying I'll go back soon or something to that effect, but with this one I'm thinking to myself...Uh, can I go back NOW?!?

Karen was good - not spectacular, but good - and better than I expected from the reviews I read.  I found my dress quickly and she definitely played a role in that by listening to my thoughts.

Move forward 7 months when the dress finally came in (after it was promised to be delivered in 6 months)...First of all, I live out of town, called a month ahead and they were still making a big deal about trying to ""fit me in"".  I went with my mom to try it on but was not taking it with me so that I could go with my dad and have him pay for it the following day.  The dress was in a nice zippered, heavy garment bag.  Was it in the same nice bag when I went to pick it up? NO. It was in nothing more than a large pink garbage bag that you would expect to receive a prom gown in.  I would expect more when paying over a grand for a dress and don't understand why they actually switched it.

Here we are 2 weeks out from the wedding...as recommended by my seamstress (who contracts with Exquisite Bride), I called Bridal Beginning to discuss taking my dress to be steamed before the big day.  When I confirmed that I purchased my dress from them but did not receive alterations there, she immediately switched tone and said she'd need to have someone else call me back.  During the 2nd phone call, I was told that it would be a $100 charge for steaming!!!  When brides spend a great deal of money on their gowns, you would think the least they could do is steam a dress free of charge regardless of whether or not you use their alterations dept.  Maybe I'm out of line thinking I shouldn't have to pay, but apparently this is the service one will receive at Exquisite Bride and I'm sure other bridal salons who obviously offer much higher quality customer service!  

You may be lucky to find a decent sales rep like I did, but overall customer service is terrible!",3,vOcPWm9JGdYZBTXLY00WYg

I ordered a small cappuccino (because I'm obsessed) and loves every ounce of it. Shortly thereafter, my scrambled eggs with goat cheese showed up. To my surprise, the portion was huge. There was fresh fruit on my plate. And, the smoked salmon that I ordered on the side was perfect (yes capers!). Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great and everyone in the establishment looked to genuinely be pleased. The staff was also super friendly (that always helps!).

The restaurant was not very busy so they had all the diners in one small area so it felt kind of weird being in this island of activity in an otherwise empty room. The decor was pretty interesting to look at though. The servers here are all very well trained. Ask any question about the menu and they have a spiel ready to go. The cocktails sounded good, but no one else wanted to try one since they were so expensive, so I didn't get to enjoy since I didn't want to drink alone.

Like I said, we all did the rodizio, which I thought would be more popular, but it seemed like the vast majority of tables were ordering off the menu. There is no buffet here. Instead you get a gaucho platter that has a selection of salads, meats, cheese, beans, and corn. I actually found this to be the best part of the meal. The salads were really good. You can ask for more if you'd like, but I held back since I wanted to save room for meat. You're also supposed to get bread, but we never got bread. They seemed to be somewhat inconsistent on that. The table next to us got bread right after they ordered, we never got bread, and the table across from us got bread after they had finished eating and looked kind of upset about it. It appeared to be just normal bread though. It would have been nice if they offered the cheese bread. That table that got their bread at the end seemed kind of cursed the whole time we were there. They were there before us and also both ordered the rodizio, but the gauchos kept skipping them. I think it was because they barely touched their salad. They continued to get skipped even after we were getting meat. The guy sat their the whole time glaring, but never said anything. They should adopt the red/green system here. Our busser was especially good. She never let our drinks go empty for long. 

This is my third trip to a Brazilian BBQ and I think I liked the meat here the most. The other places I have tried had more variety, but the quality didn't seem as good and also the seasoning they used wasn't as overpowering. That being said, I don't think I like Brazilian BBQ. It's just too much meat for me.",0,DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw

The decor is nice and modern but that's about it. We sat down and waited 10 minutes before someone asked if we had placed a drink order. There were probably 10 people seated so it wasn't busy. I ordered the New England Benny which was good but my wifes Country Fried Steak looked like a thick cut piece of pot roast that was breaded and fried. It was very dry and stringy. My daughters Red Velvet pancakes where dry as well even with cream cheese frosting. The food was ok but the faults lie in the wait staff. They werent rude, just absent. We had to ask 2 times for sugar (which isnt on the table) for my wife's ice tea and thank goodness for ordering water cause after finishing our drinks no one even bothered to check and see if we needed refills or even how our meal was. We say or waitress 3 times total. Once to order both our drinks and meal cause we had more then enough time to look and 2 times when she dropped off our meals. That was it. The only time we had prompt service is when my wife spilled her water and a server magically appeared with a towel next to me. The part that I found to be very awkward was when the check came. I handed the hostess my card, she returned with the paper for me to sign and just awkwardly stood at the table and waited for my wife to fill out the paper. That has never happened to us before. It felt like we were being hussled out. And when we left and past the hostess she didn't even acknowledge us on the way out. I'm a chef at a five star hotel on the strip and if this had happened at one of our restaurants the staff would be terminated.

My little heart was just set on turkey and stuffing! Don't get me wrong, my evening was so special for more than one reason, but being honest about the food...

We were trying to find Le Cirque, but we found this place instead, no wait, so we went in. Pricey? Oh yes, much more than I felt comfortable with being treated to. But it was beautiful with a gorgeous view of the fountain show. It felt... as casual as fancy dining could be. I was dressed up but I saw others in more casual clothes. The waiters were fancy, put my napkin on my lap etc, and called us Sir and Madam, despite the fact we were about 20 years younger than anyone else in there.

The Turkey was alright, kinda dry, but the lovely stuffing underneath made up for it. I even got my bf to eat the brussel sprouts! His pasta, he said, was one of the best he's ever had, and my cocktail was delicious as well.

My rating would be more like 3.6 stars rounded up to 4. One thing I found very strange looking at the menu was a lack of ham based sandwiches. I am a ham sandwich kind of guy, and they offered nothing ham except the build your own sandwich. Plenty of turkey, plenty of chicken, plenty of roast beef....but no ham combinations. 

I ordered the Carter, which is Turkey, avocado, bacon, bomb sauce, and cream cheese. I didn't quite taste any bacon so maybe adding more here would help. You do get your choice of extras like lettuce, tomatoes, mayo etc....so its built to your taste. $8.49 for the sandwich, and an extra $1 gets you chips and a drink.
I had mine on the Dutch crunch bread which, while interesting, is really just white bread and a crunchy like outer shell. 

Overall, a much better sandwich than Subway, Quizno's, or any of the other chain places. Really wish they had ham choices though.",2,wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A

What do I mean?  Well, there has been several Salad places nearby that didn't survive. They failed, I believe because they were either one trick ponies, or their offerings were just simply unimaginative. MAD Green brought their game face and seems serious about being around for a while. 

First the location is in the Safeway's shopping center, with several other fast options; from pizza to Chinese -- they're a lot to choose from here. Yet, they were busy the night we came in.  It's also across the parking lot from a hot yoga  place. Judging by the foot traffic, there's a great many crossover customers. 

Second, the food is heathy, and it's not. What I mean is, if you want to enjoy a salad, soup or sandwich, with low fat dressing or mayo to keep you calories count in check, you can. If on the other hand, you want to load it up with some, er higher fat extras, done!

We enjoyed the Turkey sandwich (photo) and a Soup and 1/2 sandwich combo, both were good. 

Now, if you like heat as I do, buy one of their pepper spice bottles for $5.99, see photo. You'll thank me later.  M-e-r-c-y, does that have some kick!

MAD Spice aside, expect to pay $11-$12 with an iced tea, or soft drink.

So.. at 4am you are left to stand around a counter in a drunken sleepy state while the system is ""reporting""  This happened for the second time a few weeks ago and we were standing there for about 10 minutes when I asked to speak to a manager - Finally someone came up-- obviously not the Manager, expressed no sympathy. I told him this was the second time this happened and its frustrating when its 4am and you have to wait 15 minutes to pay your bill. He seemed frustrated with  me and gave me a disgusting grimace and walked away. pshhhhhh ....

However a tad bit of history research will show you that the Coney Dog (aka Michigan dog) was founded in Jackson MI (THE ORIGINAL CONEY ISLAND) so all you native New Yorkers ""Get outta here!"" (JUST KIDDING, http://www.wikihow.com/Talk-Like-a-Stereotypical-New-Yorker).  Of course when I first moved to AZ years ago I was used to natural casing hot dogs (skin dogs).  Unfortunately Arizonian's didn't know what that was as they are familiar with the boring old skinless hot dogs.  Thus began my search for a skin dog in AZ.  After a few years I could occasionally find them in some of the grocery stores in the deli area but I still could not find them in a restaurant.  I started looking up top hot dog places in AZ and would go out of my way to find a skin hot dog but would be left with zilch.  After awhile I decided to give up my search since Arizonian's didn't like the skin dog.  My wife is from Ohio and she doesn't even like them, go figure.  I guess you have to grow accustomed to it but once you like them no other hot dog is ever the same.  Finally a place called Portillo's opened in Tempe and knowing they were from Chicago I decided to give them a try.  I even asked my friend Sam if they had skin dogs and she assured me they did.  I went up to the counter and asked if their hot dogs were skin dogs and they said yes.  However I mistakenly ordered the big hot dog as I didn't know there was a difference and when I got it it was just another SKINLESS hot dog.  I was extremely disappointed and went back to my friend and told her Portillo's does not have skin dogs.  She told me again that they did so we went together the next time so she could prove me wrong.  It turns out they do have skin hot dogs but you have to order the regular hot dog as the bigger one is indeed just skinless.  It was good but something was still missing, THE CHILI PERHAPS?  Well I didn't think I'd be getting true MI chili but another friend of mine (Colin) told me about Detroit Coney Grill as it had just opened.  He asked if I had been there which I hadn't.  One day I decided to visit and low and behold they had Better Made chips by the register!  I knew I was on to something because Better Made is made in Detroit.  These are NOT your salty Lays!  So I started talking to the owner about the hot dogs and he explained they were skin dogs.  PEOPLE THEY ALSO HAVE CURLY FRIES LIKE MI!  I began eating the hot dog but wasn't expecting the chili to taste like MI chili BUT IT WAS!  The coney dog is just like back home, chili and all.  So IMO there is nothing better than a hot dog from DETROIT.  Detroit Coney Grill also has good burgers but that's not why I come, GET THE CONEY DOG!",0,sMycMPZvUidN58m8ktr1dA

The French toast came in cubes and the presentation was very nice. Each cube was browned and crisp with a subtle cinnamon flavour. Though the bowl of cubes seemed small, it was quite filling (not sure if it was from being a bit oily tasting)

My hubby got the Ohayo breakfast which included a matcha latte. The latte was a bit bitter for his tastes so he opted for more syrup. The milk bread toast came with butter and a red bean paste which was quite tasty.

I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person. I'm convinced that the only reason most restaurants are open is because people have no where else to go. Jalisco earns it place.",2,rn-_cjZ8CPKXgORgaueWzw

It's fitting then that it's christened for a famed Italian Formula One champion. The resto features racing iconography and postcards regaling diners of its namesake, Albert Ascari; a man who was as enthusiastic about eating as he was with driving at high speeds, i.e., a Man.

Though it isn't enormous, there are quite a few tables inside which make it well suited for groups large or small. The decor is mostly subtle, modern and grey, which is as far from nonna's design sensibilities as I can imagine. I enjoyed the long bar, where bottles of wines slotted themselves into Tetris-like wall shelves.

Their menu comprises of starters, salads, and pasta. Quite simple. The drinks menu is actually more substantial. They have a handful of inspired cocktails (Fernet-marinated kumquat in a Manhattan? Say what?), some bubbles, and a solid selection of red and white by the bottle or glass. When the description promised the that the Cacc'e Mmite di Lucera ""tasted like purple"" we had to order a bottle of this red. Pretty dark and fruity and a respectable match for the eats.

Our foursome started off with the Antipasto Ciccio which was a platter of meats, cheeses and spreads served on a large charcuterie board. It's quite an array: provolone, quince jam, honey comb, a grape seed mustard, pickled veg, honeyed chestnuts, olives, and three kinds of salami all served with a small basket of soft bread. I thought the meats fell a little flat but everything else was interesting enough, and it was sufficient for four people to share. We also ordered the Crostini alla Toscana: three crostinis topped with a generous dollop of chicken liver mousse, capers and sage. I could eat about a dozen of these bad boys. 

The pasta was flawless.Two-bites-in everyone was thrilled with what was on their plate. I was impressed (with myself) for ordering the casarecce with sausage, tomato sauce, peppers, and fennel. Simple but extremely satisfying, and a Big Boy portion. I also snuck a bite of the other pastas on the table; everything was great.

We polished things off with a three-layered semifreddo of maple, quince, and chamomile and cappuccino. A wonderfully light closer to a fantastic meal. With a bottle of wine, an appetizer and dessert dinner for two came to $120, which is well worth it. I shall return!

Obligatory Title Pun: Leave V-ROOOOM for dessert!

Menu Readability: Fabulous design. And I really dig that azure blue.

Need to mention: At present they only take cash and debit.

I'd just like to start out by saying I really have to give the BB kudos - they and the Griffin really stuck out their necks (and pocketbooks) to forge ahead solo on Fremont East before it became established as the hipster haven it is becoming / has become. For that alone, they earn my respect. A friend and I stopped in early one evening when they first opened - I remember a well stocked bar and foxy tattooed bartenders that were really nice to boot!

Since then I've seen some terrific bands there over the years both inside and outside on the back patio, such as Nashville Pussy (outside in freezing temps), Andre Williams, various punk rock bowling shows, and the amazing Bellrays performed to an audience of five one night stuffed into the space in one of the front window bays. That said, I seem to enjoy this place less and less each and every time I come.

First off - it's TOO FREAKIN' LOUD inside. Whether there's a band playing or a DJ spinning records the sound level in this place borders on painful. There is such a thing as a comfortable music level - even for loud rock and roll in a divey bar. I know, I know...if it's too loud, you're too old - well, maybe I am.

Secondly - BEER IN A CAN (blaaargh). The Beauty Bar used to serve bottled beer (that you would pour into a plastic cup to go out on the patio). I understand the safety concerns and the reasons behind the plastic party cup, but seriously?  Can you not have ONE decent light beer bottled or on tap? Nothing bums me out more than beer in a can. For real. 

I really want to love the BB - and I didn't mind it there for a while - but it seems to get more low budget and lackluster each and every time I go.  This last time we went my friend asked for scotch - and they stared at her quizzically before telling her they don't have scotch. At a bar. Kind of sad, when they have so much possibility to be a stellar venue.",4,KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ

Having been to a few of these Room Escape places already, I have to say, I was pretty impress with Prison Breaker.

Prison Breaker is very easy to get to as it is right at Market Village, so if you do not own a car, travelling wouldn't be such a big problem.  Secondly, they have games you can play as complementary for playing one of their 3 rooms!  A jits (Foosball) table, a dart machine and lots of board games to play before or after their Room Escape Adventures!  Thirdly, their ventilation is very good, so I wasn't sweating while being trapped in the room compared to other competitors.  Last but not least, their staffs are super friendly and very sociable!

Currently Prison Breaker has 3 rooms, I went to their newest room HERO and I have to say it was FUN!  Although it was quite difficult, but the excitement of finding and solving clues one by one in their hardest room is very satisfying!  To avoid any spoilers, I will leave it as that and let you try it out yourself!

Just like the other Room Escape places, they do help you take pictures and put them on their Facebook page and also on their the ""Hall of Fame"" or ""Wall of Shame"" board.  So try to make it to the Hall of Fame board!!

They are open on Friday to Sunday and only by appointments from Monday to Thursday, but regardless, I recommend making a reservation on their website or via phone to ensure you can play the room you want!!

I love restaurants in old houses. I loved the dim lighting and relaxing environment. It was classy but still comfortable. This would be a great option for a date. Our service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly and relaxed but still on top of everything. I noticed that the busser was a little more aggressive... reaching over people to grab plates or pour water... but it was not a big deal.

To start off, I got the beet carpaccio. This was a delicious dish. Even though there was not a whole lot of it on the plate, there were still many different flavors to enjoy. Sour from the lime vinaigrette, sweet from the dollops of coconut pudding and hibiscus syrup, and spicy from the thinly sliced jalapeno. Best part was the golden beets which tasted very fresh and perfectly cooked. My dining companions got the corn chowder which they both raved about as well. For entrees, the three of us got one of each items offered and all were pretty tasty. The paella was savory goodness but the shrimp maybe could have used a little more seasoning or flavor. My chicken dish once again kept me entertained with multiple flavor profiles. The briny and mustardy brussel sprouts chiffonade was almost like a German sauerkraut. The chicken was rich, flavorful, roasted dark meat. And the biscuit and apple butter gave it just a touch of sweetness. Really good plate and it was arranged so that you could get a bit of each in every bite. For dessert the other two girls ordered the chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse. They both loved this!! I had a bite and I have to say it was pretty darn good. The mousse had a very roasted peanut flavor and was not too sweet and the chocolate cake was simple and the perfect accompaniment. My friend even talked the waiter into giving her some more mousse to go when he boxed up the rest of her cake. I ordered the sweet potato cheesecake to my surprise was deconstructed and served in the style of a pot de crème. Still very delicious but although I love tamarind flavor, the cubes of gelatin in this dish were out of place both in texture and flavor. They should have just been left out altogether.

The chunky salsa, which they described to me as tomatoes with vegetables???, and I said you mean like pico de gallo? and they said yes - it was basically tomatoes in a lot of juice with some onion, jalapinos and cilantro floating in it.  It had more of a taste of green peppers.  Others in my family ordered a beef burrito (that is all it had in it - just beef), a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada and nachos.  The enchiladas were not the best and the nachos were small tostada shells covered in beans and cheese with some tomatoes on them and then apparently put under a broiler to burn the edged.

I learned about chopines (essentially crazy-high platform shoes from the 16th century) and that there was a time when both men and women wore high heels. And I saw a GIANT cowboy boot and teeny tiny shoes from Coraline. I marvelled at Shaq's size 23 high top sneaker and Elton John's gayest of the gay footwear. I read A LOT about various kinds of women shoes and how they demonstrate femininity in various time periods and other parts of the world. (Maddening, yes. But also educational and you get to start to see trends).

Some of the exhibits were less interesting and less marvelous but I still dutifully read most of the little signs describing spiritual footwear and chestnut crushing boots. 

Don't go with someone who is easily bored, don't go when you yourself are feeling boring. Go when (or if) you thirst for random facts and trivia about footwear. 

I don't particularly like shoes (with the exception of colourful and comfortable sneakers) so I am proof that you don't have to love shoes to enjoy this place. Hell, maybe I enjoyed this place more because I don't like shoes (if you just want to see pretty shoes, this is not for you - there is actual history education happening in this museum!). 

All of the floors and exhibits were open when I was there, they seem to change occasionally and like any museum there will be times when some are closed. So call ahead or check the website if that sort of thing would bother you.

When to go? I would recommend going on Pay-What-You-Can Thursday nights. For those of you who dislike screaming children on field trips, there weren't any when I was there. And while I'm clearly a fan of this museum, I don't know if I would have felt I really got my moneys worth if I had paid $12. The $5 suggested donation felt just about right.

The food was good, but very expensive. ($110 for a family of four, with only two drinks ordered: beer & wine). I've visited other hibachi restaurants, received better food, better service and paid 1/4 less.

They had one of the best soups ever, but charged extra for fried rice, even with hibachi!  I've never heard of that.

The hibachi was entertaining, but we've experienced better.

Exterior of the restaurant is odd because they block off the view out the windows with some crazy print screen scenic photo.  The interior looks worn, the hibachi grill could use a thorough cleaning.  If it weren't for the decent food this place would be a total kitchen nightmare.

The staff were a little shaken the night we visited as a party seated before us was trying to complain about everything and get a teriyaki chicken removed from the bill because they suddenly realized midway through the meal they don't like teriyaki chicken.",4,nF2TR0yfB2tx3VzAMvdlgQ

So it was only natural that on this Vegas trip I made it a point to make a reservation to stay here. 

I booked a 2 bedroom panoramic suite and arrived on a Friday. The check in process was fairly easy. All desks were open and helping guests so even though there was a long line I was checked in and headed to my room in less than 15 minutes. 

The room! My gosh the room is fantastic! The suite my family and I stayed in was on the 12th floor and as the name of the room implies it has two bedrooms. One bedroom has one king bed and the other room (the bigger of the two rooms) has two queen beds. Each room has its own bathroom. The room with the king bed has a tub, two sinks and a shower while the other room had two sinks and a shower stall. 

The shared living area was huge! Two flat screen TV's, two separate sitting areas. One side had a couch and the other had a table and four very comfortable chairs. There is also a table that separates the room and sits up to five The room also boasts fantastic views of the pool and Las Vegas Strip. There is also a mini wet bar and snacks that offers alcohol and snacks for a fee. 

Now on to the rest of the property:

The casino floor seemed smaller than most other casinos on the Strip and a quick lap around the entire floor took less than 10-15 minutes. They have all the new slot machines and some of the old favorites. The table games are the same as in every other casino and the dealers and every employee on the casino floor that I encountered were friendly, courteous and were very helpful. 

There are several restaurants on the property and they range from fast food to elegant dining. The buffet was really good. I had the dinner service and Sunday brunch. 

Overall my stay at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino exceeded my expectations and then some. The property is clean, the employees are friendly and the food and beverage selection is impeccable. The cornerstone of my visit though had to be the room. It was fantastic but then again, MGM Resorts International always brings it. 

Stay here. You won't be disappointed.

The SO and I decided on Salad and Pizza before settling in for a night of disk 1, season 3 of WEEDS.  So we head over to Pizza A Metro after a quick yelp search and cruise through the ""wes-side"" of Phoenix.  Pulled up to a mini-strip mall with a Circle K and a unisex hair salon which created great interest for us because we love ""off the beaten path"" kind of places. 

We step in, notice a very clean interior with a very nice staff too-boot.Take a gander at the menu and decide on the Antipasto della Casa for starters and the Frescolina fresh Pizza. As we're waiting for our Antipasto, we're served warm flat bread and a spread that appeared to be onions, olives, and peppers. It was great! We were again greeting by the owner who exchanges small talk throughout our night adding to our great evening out.

The Antipasto was an amazing array of olives, peppers, basil, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto,and eggplant. It was almost too pretty to eat and more than enough for the two of us. 

Next was the Frescolina Pizza. Man this was one killer pizza! Tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula, the perfect layer of flavor. The sweetness of the sauce, saltiness of the prosciutto, and the peppery/bitterness of the arugula made for a perfect blend. Wait, the crust! This crust was beyond real and there were no ends left on our plates.  Now that's great crust!

So we both agreed this was one hell-of-a place and we are going to be making our way through the menu along with our standing date with our next in queue Netflix-flick!",6,jwfOpCgeob0itikBIfPi2Q

I am so thankful that I finally found a keeper.  This salon is amazing.  I had a set of acrylics put on by another salon 2 weeks ago along with a pedicure.  I was so dissappointed by the results, my nails looked like ducks feet.  The pedicure after 1 week was already chipping.  My husband was in desperate need of a pedicure and so I got on line to see what I could find based on others recommedations.  I am so thankful that I found Highlights Nails and Spa on Yelp.  My husband and I had our first appt this afternoon.  What a treat.  If you want one of the best Pedicures, treat yourself to Cindy. She was absolutely amazing and my husbands rough feet are now smooth!  Now guys, if you don't think this is for you, not manly enough, etc, my husband is one to tell you to try it.  A pedicure with a massage truly is amazing after a working on your feet.  (Guys, my hubby is as bad-ass as they get and he is sold and is going to go once a month)  Now for the rest of the experience, I mentioned my acrylic nails done by the other spa to Ali the owner.  She went and got her glasses as I was getting my pedicure, came back, took my hands and looked at my nails.  She said she could fix them.  OMG, she spent quite a bit of time working on them, they had to be completely refiled, shaped and gel put back on them. She really spent time and work on them and I have to say they haven't ever looked and felt better.  I was joking that I should have made a hair appt. as the stylist Nicole had just finished an up do on a customer that was adorable.  (My arm is in a cast right now so doing my own hair is pretty difficult), after making this comment jokinly to the owner, the next thing I know, Nicole has her straightener and blow dryer in hand and fixed my hair!  Cindy then came over and put two adorable flowers on my nails.   Brandi did my pedicure and my nails and feet feel fabulous.  I left there thinking I had just spent a luxurious day at a first class spa.  This is one of the cleanest most comfortable spas I have been to.

I came in on Saturday feb 10th, 2018 to get my usual SNS fill, and told the lady I had tons of time and wasn't in a rush. The first girl that came to me had such a terrible attitude and didn't even want to do my nails, and pushed them off to an older man who looks like he only does pedicures from what I've seen. He did by far the most PAINFUL fill I've EVER had. He didn't even follow safety or cleanliness protocol I swear. He was sharing the file machine heads with a lady next to him, EW, and using tools no one ever does on my nails He seemed pretty tired and was blinking really hard to pay attention. 

The painful part was when he pushed my cuticles back, instead of trimming them and doing the whole manicure to make them PRETTY, he took a metal shaver and grinder them off each nail, and dig the metal edge into every cuticle, causing them to sting each time. The whole manicure was about 6 steps total which blew my mind because every other time is a detailed process of other steps. 


When I was paying I let the front desk girl know they look great but it was by far the most painful experience I've had here and to let the management know he needs to be retrained. She nodded and made an excuse for him being heavy handed. He isn't heavy handed, he is uneducated.

Just putting out there, their food is not AUTHENTIC Taiwanese food. The sour MSG aftertaste completely kills the food for me. Their food is also way too greasy and the sauce is mixed weirdly. It all tastes really artificial. 

Do not recommend this place, but what can you do when there is no edible Taiwanese food in town. Beggars can't be choosers.",3,2AxoUMKy4fM-WikXbIPcmA

My wife and I have dined here several times since it opened as its very close to home and different than anything else in the Lake Wylie area.  We've tried several dishes and they have - hands down - the best spaghetti and meatballs in the Charlotte area.  Definitely better than the chain choices like Maggiano's or Buca Di Beppo.  

We've never had any service issues that other's have complained about.  Service is always speedy and extra polite in nicely pressed clothes and aprons giving an air of sophistication and specialness to every meal.

What the owners have done to the interior of what used to be a Japanese steakhouse is a real testament to wise design choices.  A few booths are tucked into the far side of the restaurant and some nice larger tables in the center, and a few romantic two-tops on the edges.  There is also one large table right at the entrance for large groups.  There is a small bar which has local brews on draft as well as a few stools for those so inclined to prefer bar seating.  The lighting is soft, dark enough for an intimate romantic dinner, but bright enough that a social night out with friends feels open and inviting.  

Sweetwater, Copper, or T-Bones this is not - and that is a nice choice to have in an area inundated with bars and party places which seem to have taken over the Lake Wylie restaurant scene.

There is one caveat to my 5 star review - as some other reviewers have mentioned, the bread served with the entrees is a crunchy, bruschetta style bread served in one or two small slices.

Three days later and no call so decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and called them back. The lady I spoke to, not the same woman I spoke to a few days earlier, was not entirely friendly and put me on hold twice. After the first time, she explained that I was moving more items than last year then proceeded to list the items I moved last year. I told her that was the original list but that I had updated it about a week before I moved. She then said that I must have added things at the last minute and that they didn't charge me extra for it. I did no such thing and begged to differ with her but then she put me on hold again, this time for well over 5 minutes. I was very frustrated and had to get back to work so I hung up. I was extremely disappointed that they were not as helpful as last year so I felt the need to update my review and give them one star.

Food - Portions are huge but are expensive (one person dinner is $16). After placing my order, the food took approx 20 minutes to arrive. That's way too long. And the food was COLD! I still ate it. I had chicken and mac & cheese. They were flavorful and good, but cold.

Didn't matter we got another pizza on the house.

My wife and I saw a review of this place, and looked at the website... and wow, those pictures just make the mouth water!  We couldn't wait to come by and give the place a try!  Since it was Monday, we had an entire day to wait and think about what we'd get.  We even mentioned it to friends and got their order... time to make it a great day for the little shop!

We made a special trip down to old town (30 minute drive), and came on in just after lunch.  What we found was... well... shocking.

First... the smell.  I've never in my life been to a bakery that didn't smell like a bakery, with various forms of lovely food smells.  However, when we walked in we were immediately struck by the smell of musty oil and... dust.  Not a great start.  The owner was present, and wandered out disinterestedly to help us.  We went up to look at what they had... and here is their inventory... and I'm not joking.

2 Oatmeal Rye Cookies
2 Mesquite Chocolate Chip Cookies
2 Cow Puncher Cookies
1 Cupcake of some form, which was the SOLE occupant of their glass case
Several bags of packaged popcorn
Several bags of packaged brittle
Miscellaneous tubs of ice cream

That's it.  In total.

We asked about getting some of the Mesquite Chocolate Chip Cookies, but the owner told us that they liked to make everything fresh.  As in ""please wait 45 minutes so we can bake new cookies"".  Um... what?  Note that the website says ""call ahead for cakes""... not ""call ahead to have us actually have even a fraction of our inventory available, even cookies"".

I have never in my entire life seen a retail establishment that was more poorly conceived and executed.  If the owner wishes to run a catering business, great... run a catering business... but stop pretending you run a shop.

When I walked in there I was walking in severe pain from old auto accidents, stress and a multitude of sins I just let go until I got to the breaking point meaning I couldn't stand more than about 10 minutes at most and walking had become super painful and slow.  My hips were twisted again from an old motorcycle accident which throws off everything it seems, and--because of some previously painful and questionable work done by a Chiro in Illinois--I never went back to one when I came to Arizona.
My regular Phoenix Physician wanted to send me to a Pain Management Dr. so he could what?  Mask the pain I guess which seemed awfully stupid to me, so I bit the bullet and started looking for a local Chiro here.  I'm so glad I did, too...and soooo glad I found Dr. Rick especially.
Since my experiences with two other old time Chiros in llinois used old school techniques I went in there kinda scared:  you know what I mean with the twisting of the neck and the cracking and all.  I was always sure I was going to end up a paraplegic.  They were rough, their treatments didn't last all that long and they didn't suggest any after-care or exercises--just come see me again when you can't walk without pain.  Kinda discouraging really.
Dr. Rick uses new techniques which I had never experienced before which are much more gentle (and a heckofalot less scary) but get the job done.  He will suggest exercises and after-care if needed.  He WILL take care of you because he really CARES about his patients (you can tell it), he loves his work (again, you can tell it) and he will listen carefully to what you tell him throughout your appointment and will answer any questions about your care that you have.  
He's very professional, and seems to have absolutely no problem in educating his patients on what he is doing and why.  Frankly, I never had a Chiro do that before and I really appreciate it.  He even makes his cell phone number accessible and encourages you to call him with any questions you might have after you leave there...can you imagine that one?
Very low rates and excellent service.  I cannot give any more stars to this Chiropractor, but, if I could, I would,  I am extremely happy with his work and am getting my friends to go to him, too.  He's making me well, and I'm so very grateful for his skill, knowledge and caring...thanks for enabling me to live sans pain, Dr. Rick!  And just as much, thank you for not charging me an arm and a leg for doing it!",1,R6vb0FtmClhfwajs_AuusQ

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry.",1,zEAWtjwUPaCDsfuDlKkJaA

I wasn't going to budge but then he gave me a small sample and I immediately changed my order from beef shawarma to the brisket. 

Not only did I change it, but every person behind in line also changed their order when he also gave them a sample piece. I came back to work and the brisket, on a bed of greens, looked and smelled so good that 4 or my colleagues went and got it too. They too loved it!

I had 4 criteria for the rental company:
1. I wanted an experienced rental and tour company with a good reputation.  I have heard horror stories about bad rentals on-line, particularly in AZ.
2. I wanted some place with interesting geological features.  Another downside of motorcycling in Chicago is straight, flat roads.  I wanted something interesting to ride on.
3. A place that rented exotic bikes (i.e. something other than Harleys.  Nothing against Harleys, I just wanted to try something different)
4. Something in the $100 or less/day range.  I'm an off-season tourist because I'm looking for a bargain. 

MC Tours met all of these very easily.  They were well reviewed by their past customers (on an admittedly biased ""guestbook"") and it was clear to me that they knew what was up with their very professional and knowledgeable communications.  They were answering my lists of questions I hadn't even asked yet.  

Obviously Arizona's Red Rocks area, along with the Grand Canyon and Tucson Valley make for gorgeous sight seeing, so I knew I was going to have some great destinations, but Monica and Gabor at MC Tours showed me some great roads to travel on that were as much fun as the destination.  

The Bikes at MC Tours were just what I was looking for.  I ended up getting a BMW R1200GS for 6 days, but had other more touring minded options as well as some cruisers.  Triumphs, BMWs, Kawasakis.. Lots of options.  The bikes were immaculate and Gabor gave me a great rundown on what to expect from the bike and how to operate it.  He had the kind of expertise that only comes from having ridden the bike and knowing what it will do.  He wasn't just regurgitating the manual to me.  The bikes came with a disc lock and GIGANTIC saddlebags for no extra charge and had GPS and several other options available.  I personally like the old fashioned paper maps and wasn't doing any off-roading so I skipped the GPS.  

They had a great ""Mileage saver"" option available to me since it was off-season, and even though I went over the miles per day allowance of the cheaper option, the overages still came out to be less than the more expensive unlimited mileage packages.  I certainly wasn't stressing about my mileage or watching the odometer very closely.  I managed to pack in 1200 miles with just about 5 full days of riding and still managed to save $300 over the other options.",4,WtAJV3Ibw5Oz-NE8DIrUWg

The staff here is nice and attentive.  You also have a bar that's stocked and when you smell the armoa of food in the air you'll also want a bite to eat.

Low key joint. Small exclusive little cafe hidden in the very corner. Wasn't that hard to find. Went in when they were just open so I had the whole place to myself. 

Menu serves all sorts of drink ranging from coffee drinks to milk teas and smoothies. The center of attention are there desserts. I ordered the cheese cake, multi layered cake and two other drinks. Very sweet and wonderful will be how I'll describe everything. The Matcha multi layered cake is the reason why I stopped here. There're so many post regarding this so I had to check it out. Very eye catching when it was all put together, probably there most famous dessert on the menu. 

Definitely recommending this to all my sweet tooth people. Can't say anything I ordered were bad, very much enjoyed everything and looking to return very soon. Service and food 10/10. 

Order the infamous layered cake !!!",1,Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw

Many dishes didn't exceed our expectations, they mostly fell short by a few notches. There was only a slim list of memorable items on the menu. The best thing that we ordered was surprisingly the sake nigiri (salmon). It was super moist, buttery and incredibly sweet! We ended up ordering 4 rounds of it. 

Tempura mussels - the mussels were very large but they were also super awkward to eat. You can't bite it in half, so you have to pretty much pop the whole big piece into your mouth. Make sure to get some (or a lot) of that spicy mayo wasabi caviar sauce on the bite- that sauce made it! 

Fish tacos - they were perfectly bite sized, crispy and refreshing. Yet, I felt that they could of used another note of flavor. It was lacking depth. I ended up dipping my fish taco into the tempura mussel's spicy mayo wasabi caviar sauce and it set it off to whole notha level! It went from good to great! 

Miso marinated black cod - we enjoyed the small piece of marinated black cod, it was moist, buttery and flavorful - until my boyfriend swallowed a pin bone. There were a bunch of them so he had to pick them all out carefully in order for us to enjoy the fish. I don't know if they dropped the ball on our dish or if someone forgot to notify us that this fish had bones in it still, but anyway you want to put it, it was very uncomfortable for him since he had pin bones stuck in his throat after eating this dish. I also took a picture of the annoying little bones that stab your throat as you swallow. 

Poke nachos on top of fried crispy lotus root chips - they were beautiful and the tuna tasted fresh, however the poke marinade and seasoning was very dry and bland. There was nothing memorable or worthwhile about this dish. 

Usuzukuri - halibut sashimi in a special ponzu sauce. As pretty as this dish looked, I had an issue with the flavor profile. It was bland and didn't celebrate the halibut. Plus the halibut was sliced in such a way that it was not tender and buttery.  

Yellowtail jalapeño - Sashimi grade yellowtail topped with jalapeño and a yuzu cilantro sauce. The cucumber took away from the yellowtail's delicious flavor and delicate texture. We chose to eat the rest without it. This isn't a winning dish, the fish was fresh, but the yuzu cilantro sauce was bland and basic. 

Halibut and Salmon nigiri - Both were delicate and fresh. The salmon had to of been the top dish of the night. It was incredibly sweet and buttery. My salmon addicted tongue was overjoyed!

Miso soup - it was salty beyond enjoyment. I didn't finish it. 

It was very pricey, we spent about $90 or so on our bill and we were food coma stuffed, but there were way too many flaws here and there for me to fully be satisfied with this place.",1,u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ

It was nice seeing the lion dance in the Asia plaza but we had to bail. We tried again Sunday at 10:30 and there was not even a wait. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get drinks ordered.

We came for the dim sum and that is exactly what we got. Between 3 people we felt like there was an endless amount of dishes we picked out.

Definitely recommend!

We had the typical dishes, shu-mai, pot stickers, congee soup, steamed pork ribs, turnip cake, shrimp noodle rolls, beef tripe, and wood ear mushroom salad. I'm a huge fan of turnip cake and they were definitely up there but everything else was pretty average.

We decided to share 2 apps (crispy potatoes as well as the chips with guac) and a wild mushroom pizza.

The pizza was delicious, get the white truffle oil to drizzle on top.

The prices for the pedicures were either $25 for a basic, or $45 for everything else. To me that was kind of high. I usually go to a salon in North Las Vegas that charges $25-35 for the exact same pedicures using the same exact spa products. My pedicure came out nice and the lady doing it really took her time. The massages were a little too gentle where it felt like she was just rubbing her hand over my leg. But I appreciated that she really took her time and did a nice job on my toes. 
While getting my pedicure, another lady was working on my manicure. They didn't have white chrome gel which is what I wanted. So they did their best to accommodate it to something similar. The gel I got is white glitter, not really a polish. She had to put it on with a brush. I didn't really like the texture of my nails because it was painted on so uneven. The color itself looks nice and I liked that she really tried to mix colors and glitter to get me the color I want.
Im not sure how I feel about the service. I felt like any time I voiced a concerned really nicely, they would snap back and be really rude.

Scaredy Cat conducted a few tests (only ones absolutely necessary so to not gouge me) and definitively found he has herpes!! This effects his sinuses, not curable but easy to treat when he has flare ups. After a few days on the meds our cat, we nicknamed snarfy, had no nasal issues. We both cried during our follow up visit that they fixed our baby. Beyond this everyone there is amazing. They go above and beyond to provide superior service. We drove 45minutes each way to go there with no regrets.
I am very picky in vets and now that we moved to Portland I worry about not finding anything comparable to Scaredy Cat.
Thank you Melanie, Dr. Wood (she solved our boy's illness, Dr. Grant (so patient even when our boy sprayed him) and ALL of the staff at Scaredy Cat. We love you all and will miss you!",0,65HETxu3epHRChM0oBsO9A
n1ds3eXwBDIRaxp9wDgbDw,1,2015-11-30 00:14:26,2,bAMjU_M6sfKZCrI3dXRjxQ,3,"Is it really worth the money?

Community = 4: Mostly students and professionals. It does stay pretty quiet aside from the normal passing rudeness that comes with living among students (loud music from cars, screaming in the garage, etc). 

The hallways smell different almost every day! At least twice a week, it is burnt bacon. At least once a week, our neighbor leaves raw fish or chicken outside their door instead of walking it to the trash compactor. 

The company/concierge does try to create community events; we haven't attended any but they are usually well reviewed (i.e. Octoberfest with 13 beer selections, Sunday breakfasts, etc.). 

Grounds = 2: Inside the gates, everything is okay. For the most part, the trash is picked up. Now... outside the gate is a different story. Some of it is their property, some isn't; however, you'd think they would pick up the trash directly outside their front entrance even if it wasn't considered part of their property. 

Would you keep trash littered outside your front lawn and just say ""the city needs to handle that""? Probably not.

Crime/Safety = 1: Again, inside the gates, everything seems fine. However, we realized that all of the gates are high enough that even a large human could roll underneath. 

About a month ago, some homeless guy got in and was jumping from car to car outside the garage. Two months ago, a homeless guy set all of his stuff on fire about 3-6 feet outside of the gate. It caused a small explosion and there was a lot of smoke. Realistically, if he had any kind of lighter fluid he would have been able to get it into the complex quite easily. A month ago, a homeless guy got stuck in the drainage tunnel directly outside our window; it took hours for the police to get him out, and they had to cut down two gates to do it. 

Most of this stuff only affected us because it was late at night or really loud, etc. This isn't the kind of place where you can go for a walk/run right outside your neighborhood.

Staff = 3-4 (depending on the day): For the most part, the office staff is pretty nice. However, when they get busy they can get a little snippy. Sadly, they are usually busy, so for the most part I'd give them a 3. Also, they can be kind of all over the place. 

We still haven't been given any information about things we should have been told upon move-in. One person said another person would help us and vice versa. We've lived here for a couple of months now, so we just leave things alone at this point. 

Basically: if they are having a good day, you will get 4 star service or better. If they are having a bad day, you will get 3 star service or worse.

Amenities = 4: Everything in the photos online is legit. Great gym, really nice pool upstairs. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is the quality of some things offered has faded since the initial reno.

Location = 4-5: Pretty close to everything, but pretty much everything it is close to is dirty. While this place is only a mile from the strip, the mile is definitely clear. 

Basically: if you want to live in a location where even your grocery store, shopping centers and restaurants are nice, do not move in here. 

Views = 2-3: The east side of our apartment faces some mountains, but the south side of our apartment faces part of the UNLV campus. Which part are we across from? The giant solar panels. 

So the view outside our master bedroom and both balconies is two giant solar panels, a dirty sewer, and construction on Flamingo Road. 

Maintenance = 2-3: Staff is okay, there is one guy who is really nice... but for the most part, they will talk to you 1) any kind of way and 2) like you are an idiot. I know I don't appreciate being lied to, talked over or repeatedly given excuses. If you can find a way to fix something yourself, a YouTube video will probably be of more help. 

The cleaning staff is nice, but make sure you check your place out thoroughly upon move-in. Everything above 5.5/6ft in the apartment was untouched; the new resident should not be the one getting on the ladder to clean up, especially in the kitchen. The hallways don't get deep cleanings; sometimes we pass the same piece of trash for two weeks.

Apartment = 3-4: For the most part, we have a nice apartment. Still, the things we are paying for are cheap or fake imitations. The renovations completed by the current company have seen their fair share of destruction since. Things also seem to be permanently dirty, things like the toilets. Something is wrong with the electric system in the 2nd bathroom. In certain rooms, if you leave the lights on too long - get this - it smells like fish (I can't make that up smh). 

Basically: it looks nice when you are walking through quickly, but the longer you stay, the more you realize that this was installed incorrectly, or that is crooked, or this has a crack down the side, or this was painted accidentally (a very big problem in our unit). For the price you are paying, you expect more.",2,NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q

Most food when delivered is less exciting than what it had been portrayed as by online stock photos, to greasy and oily or portions are not substantial enough to justify prices.

That was not the case with China Wan Wan.  We ordered shrimp fried rice which was delicious the shrimp was not over cooked and the rice was still fluffy.  Despite being in a small container there was sooooo much food.  We had also ordered the fun fun noodles, not entirely sure what to expect, the large take out box was enough to feed us both two times. 

Our only complaint was the crispy of the egg rolls had faded with the process of delivery and had turned a bit offputtingly mushy.

He was very knowledgeable, answered all my dumb questions without making me feel like an idiot and bottom line i walked out of there with a little less money and alot happier. i have now been back multiple times for juice, advise and just to hang out and bs and every time its the same. greeted as soon as i enter the door no matter how busy he is and they make you feel like you are old friends.

Mozzarella sticks were mostly breading, which is sad when they're $1/stick and falling apart. The marinara dipping sauce was the tastiest part of the meal.
I knew I shouldn't have asked about their soups but the $2.50/cup of potato soup tasted like it was fresh out of the can, devoid of any seasoning whatsoever.

The only thing that has kept me coming as long as I have has been the food.  I rarely get a bad meal here.  What has gotten noticeably worse is the staff.  They manage to outdo themselves with each and every new hire.

My last and final visit, I approached the counter smiling, and my cashier, a young and snotty girl approached the register from the cooking area and sighed in my face.  She put her hands on the register and did not raise her eyes to even greet me.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt... I'd probably feel like killing myself too if I worked at Wendy's.

""Hi!  This is gonna be for here today"", and she didn't say anything, or even click a button on the register.  So I said it again, and she shrugged a little, so I continued with my order.

I then made the mistake of handing her a gift card that had less than the total of the order left on it.  Her response: ""Ugh, hole on"".  She then left me at the register for about three minutes, giving me time to contemplate how I'd reached this point in my life, and why I continue to put up with such inconsiderate people.

She eventually returned, with her iPhone in hand, and had the calculator app open.  She looked at it and barked ""You owe me $7.40!"" (Never mind the fact that registers typically count money for you)  I was just surprised she had a voice box to be honest. I then handed over a credit card to cover the rest of the total she had pulled out of thin air, and she turned to her fellow employees and screamed ""Oh, how I do dis?!""

What can you do at this point but shake your head in disbelief?

I filled out their pointless survey off the back of the receipt, never got a response, but it's worth noting that as of this review they had a 95.5 inspection rating.  Anyone that eats at Wendy's regularly knows that they cannot get lower than a 100 due to hiring ""Safe Serve"" certified employees, which automatically earns you a few free points.  Take that as you will, but if you consider the cashier to be on the same mental level as the cooks, you'll understand how you get such a comparatively low score.",2,S1UUx2QhZ5K7DBQ7222WyA

Thumbs up as well for the Jerk Chicken meal with the added veg & fried plantain which nicely rounded out the overall flavour profile of the dish.

First time it was the hood latch (dealer wanted $700 to fix it and another establishment in town wanted $100 to take a look at it.) Joe fixed it for $10 by fixing the broken part rather than replacing the entire assembly.

In the second instance, the ignition key was not turning and would work only if after wiggling it around for a few minutes. Joe looked at it and advised that we replace the ignition lock (after 20 years and 200K miles of use) because the tumblers were worn out. No estimating charges to provide the quote were levied on us and the price to recode a new ignition lock was a lot less than a dealer. 

Joe is a person with tons of integrity, and one who is not out to capitalize on a bad automotive situation (like many others would, particularly if you are from out of town). He is a great mechanic with in-depth knowledge and expertise on volvos and most other cars.

We recommend additional preventive maintenance. It's better for your car!""

Just to mention a few things they recommend:

Every 15K miles clean the throttle body.
Every 30K miles flush coolant. 
Every 30K miles clean fuel injectors???

Ha ha ha!

There is a lot more of those. They are prepared to recommend you a few hundred dollars of unnecessary services regardless of what mileage your vehicle has. 

Part 2:

I went there once with a dead battery. They ""diagnosed"" for 1 hour and told me the battery was fine, my problem was in the alarm system. I left, removed the alarm, jump started my car multiple times and drove back in a few days with the same problem. They diagnosed for another  hour and agreed the battery needed to be replaced. I waited another hour or two to get a new battery under warranty.

First, our hostess was not very nice. We very politely asked her for a quite location for the three of us to sit and eat lunch.

We asked another girl if we could change seats and she said no problem.

We orderd the californian burger and the regular cheeseburger. 
Ugh. The bread was paper thin and soggy from all the fat drippings. THe meat was cheap, you could tell, and the fries weren't even that great.

Mix of free weights, older machines and cardio equipment.   It's like walking into a warehouse - a huge box with huge vaulted ceilings and mirrors surrounding the entire area - so you can pretty much watch yourself pump along any wall.  The pluses - bose sound systems hanging above head throughout  (classic rock seems to be the prime).  Direct TV on 13 flat screens visible only from the cardiovascular equipment - they have NFL Sunday ticket (this is really rare) and you get to personally grab the remote freely from the front desk and pick what you want from your eliptical/treadmill/stairclimber!  So football season I'm here for 3 hour cardiovascular sessions.  No other gym I know of in town gives you this remote control CONTROL.  

Also, this is the only gym I belong to/aware of that still has coed jacuzzi, sauna and steam room =) it has windows facing the interior of the gym so no hanky Panky in the jacuzzi (though a couple could steam up the steam room or raise the temperature in the sauna).  Locker rooms are communal - i.e. high school style shared hand washing and showers (they do have pull curtains).   For the serious lifters they have dumbells up 125lbls.  Cement floors.  Padded lifting floors.  They have a small room for classes and a kids club.  Starbucks and Jimmy Johns in the parking lot.  Fry's grocery and Harkins Theatre across the street.

It's got some unique pluses for being a basic box gym.  Proximity will probably be your decision factor.  The front desk guy I run into is a cool cat.

They use plastic disposable cups for water and ice cream. It started off okay, We tried the miso and sukiyaki, I personally wasn't a fan of the miso (I usually love miso) and sukiyaki was ok. 

To start, we order ONE order of ribeye, brisket, and short rib. We proceed to the salad bar grab our vegetables and come back to meat on the table. At first glance I could tell what two of the meats were but one took me off guard. I ask the waitress and she tells me it's ribeye. I was like sure whatever, it turns out it was lamb, my husband and I DO NOT eat lamb and she informs us, ironically as my husband is putting it in his mouth and he spits it out (grossly). So then I was like yeah, well I wanted the ribeye. Then next thing I know a plate of ribeye comes out and looks like it's about 8oz of meat, on top of two additional meats which we did not order. I guess we received another tables order. We tried to eat it but there was no way we could eat 10 orders of beef. 

We order ice cream and it comes in a disposable plastic cup with disposable spoon ....? What a waste. Very disappointed in that fact.",3,y7sVB3e6a5ESVlnqWC0gNA

As Richard Attenborough would say, they ""spared no expense"" in the remodel. They've transformed a generic Joey's of Chicago into a classy, snappy decor, with a twist on the unisex bathrooms. The patio outside is very welcoming when the weather permits and they did throw in a couple of TVs to catch the game.  They've added the prerequisite in Arcadia, dual garage door that opens the bar onto the patio. Should be a nice touch in a few months. 

We were greeted promptly and found a nice hi-top in the bar area. The wine and beer list is extensive. We were informed of the happy hour specials and decided that would be our focus for this visit. 

We started with their Dulce Camarones---small lightly battered fried shrimp with slice veggie garnish on a bed of lettuce with aioli. This dish was disappointing, the shrimp was small and had a very mild taste. The aioli was the strongest flavor by far, and that was muted. Then we tried the Carne Tacos and the pork tacos. The carne was moist, and delicious, the pork was mediocre. Each order came with three tacos, which were 2-3 bites each. 

We finished off with  Alitas (Grilled Wings) coated with Habanero glaze. These had a pleasant yet mild flavor, but not as spicy as I had hoped

So why the three stars? Well I'd give them 2.5 if I could. Maybe my expectations were too high based upon the previous reviews. We spent 34 dollars including tip, and didn't order any drinks. Meh, I expected and wanted more from my visit.",4,DssV9fskchomqfh7jeYavA

The daily joke at breakfast was how crappy the hotel was; we even started referring to The Blake as ""Hotel California"". 

I will start with the Pros: 

1.) Some of the staff (maintenance and some housekeepers) was nice and very helpful.
2,) The Grill bartenders and waitresses were wonderful and fun to talk to.

The Cons of the room:

1.) The floor of my room in the old tower on the 7th was flooded but they still checked us into this room anyway.  After changing our room to the newly renovated tower on the 10th floor, it didn't get any better.
 2.)  We had a huge hole in our ceiling. (They forgot to put the ceiling light in)
3.)  We stayed there for 5 days and our room was only cleaned 2 of those days.  
4.) My phone did not work in the room, so anytime I had a complaint or request I had to roll the dice and take an elevator down, (which was often broken) to talk to someone at the front desk.
5.) We even caught the housekeeper changing the door sign to ""do not disturb"" so she would not have to clean the room.
6.) The water in the shower was scalding hot, so we would have to shower at the sink for a couple of days.  A little girl also went to the hospital for minor burns due to the shower's temp being too hot.
7.) Not all of TV stations worked
8.) The thermostat did not work well leaving our room either too hot or too cold
9.) No room service; but the hotel's restaurant wasn't very good anyway
10.) No refrigerator in the room
11.) No full shower doors, 1/2 doors only which left water all over the floors, lousy design!

The Cons of the hotel:

1.) The Grill at the hotel had lousy food, reheated and often overcooked.
2.) The bell boys had some kind of kickback deal with the shuttle drivers, driving our cost to $100-$200 per ride no matter the distance, which caused me to lose my cool and say a few choice words to them about taking advantage of us.
3.) I waited over 40 minutes to talk to a night manager, and she never came out to address my complaints, she just ignored me.
4.) The Delegation breakfast in their ballroom was terrible! The first day was not so bad.  Probably same chefs from the Grill Restaurant.
5.) Snacks in the lobby for purchase were overpriced.
6.) Siding falling off of the hotel from the outside
7.) Elevators were broken
8.) Hotel was overpriced

We paid $310 per night at The Blake which outside of the DNC only cost $99 per night, which in my opinion is still too much money for this hotel.  It was shameful that this was our ""official hotel"" for the DNC, it should have been unofficially off the list weeks before our arrival. We had California delegates, dignitaries and celebrities' staying at this hotel and I promise you we will never come back here again.  

The Blake left a lasting impression on Californians that we will always remember as were riding on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disneyland!!

We had Spencer as a server and while I believe he also had a 15+ top outside plus other bar tables, he was cranking it out! He was very on point and attentive. He always checked on us. When we needed something or when something came out missing an item, he took care of it in record time.

I was very impressed with him as out waiter. The shots ($5 chilled Patron) was a good deal... We had several! The wings were good - get them extra crispy! We also got some fried pickles; which as odd as they sound, are quite good and salty. We also had a few beers before I asked for a Diet Coke (needed some caffeine!) 

We share a large cheesesteak. Unfortunately, they forgot our onions - but Spencer and the manager fixed it right away. The steak was sadly very over-cooked and chewy; I probably wouldn't order that again. The chips were good with ranch. ...and the ranch was quite good too!

Firefly is a nice place off the strip with a nice menu. We've done Jaleo in our hometown (it's a go to) so we venture away from the Vegas locations to try Firefly. The white sangria stood out as the best thing we ordered. With four of us we order 10 plates and they were all good - nothing to really complain about - but nothing that stood out. Nice staff. The mark down is for the roaming photographer who's running some sort of ""you're on the rollercoaster at DisneyWorld and want to buy pictures."" She took a few and then came back to pass along a 'free' photo and offerings to sell. I don't need someone selling me photos at dinner - it's cheap and...cheap. And, vaguely unprofessional for a restaurant. If the manager reads this, knock it off. It's awful. Ran about $125 for ten plates, a pitcher of sangria, and two coffees.",0,2fW4ccGGcaPmn_HSCPPnpg

Had about a 15 minute wait for a table of two, which isn't terrible considering it's a Sunday morning. It was our first visit so we took some time looking over the menu and observing the restaurant in general. 

The menu is your traditional breakfast diner menu. We ordered chicken fried chicken with hash browns two over medium eggs, with two biscuits and biscuits and gravy with two over easy eggs and a side of bacon. If you can't tell by the two orders, they each come with a lot of food. These portion sizes are big! We both really enjoyed our meals, the biscuits were also big winners. There are zero complaints regarding our food or the service, it was all pretty good. 

The restaurant itself is fast paced. Tables were emptying out just as fast as they were filling in. I'd say that's because the food is good, but the tables and seats themselves are not comfortable. The booth seats are made from wood slats and the chairs are a hard metal or plastic. Each table had bowls of coffee creamer out, but it's not clear how often they clean them out because both ours and the table's next to ours were covered in syrup and another in a dried liquid (ew). I'd be willing to give a pass on one table, but then another? That's a trend. Most diners I've been to have that great diner coffee, this one did not.

After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a ""buy one get one free"" bowl of noodles.

We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. 

After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.

We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.

All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares. 

Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",0,TN2tgE6KxNWleIqEJjPqtA

On the Darwinian continuum of diveyness Angelo's Lounge must be an amoeba. This has all the trappings of a hipster dive bar, but it falls short of the features you find at places like Bikini, Shady's or places in Tempe. Perhaps 10 years from now this will be a hipster hot spot.  Lately with new ownership they're reportedly starting to book bands more often.

I went here with Bonnie to see a friend's band perform and I couldn't believe the inside of this place. It was freaking surreal like watching a bad movie in slow motion.

Is that really an 70 year old alcoholic trucker with a ZZ Top beard sitting three stools down from an indie-rock 25 year old Tempe girl?

* Two pool tables.
* No beers on tap, but Miller High Life by the bottle.
* Cash only.
* Mismatched floors.
* Gross bathrooms with 80s-glitter inlaid sinks
* Brick fireplace in the corner.
* Jukebox with Linkin Park, Reba McEntire and Neil Diamond. Nuff said. 
* Falling water: the untrendy kind - like from a leaking roof here and there throughout.
* Decrepit ceiling fans that looked like they were about to fall and go flying.
*A veritable Mason-Dixon line of humanity: sketchy, trashy looking old fogeys and their admirers toward the front, indie rock-luvin hipsters toward the back. We were probably somewhere near Philly. And best of ALL...

We started off with 3 orders of the chocolate dusted beignets, that arrived freshly fried to order with a side of two sauces: nutella and a rasberry jam. Fantastic. Fresh and airy, lightly dusted, and with sweet sauces (save the sauces for the bread you'll get later). Which by, the way, is also very good. 

We also ordered a variety of fresh baked goods. i went with the cheese danish (which was a little thicker than I was used to, but still fantastic with creamy cheese in the center), we also had the sticky buns, which was just ridiculously good. Not too dry, not too sweet, perfectly sticky.

Our table ordered a variety which included the Sourdough Waffles with Strawberry, the French Toast (signature dish), the chicken and waffles (with bacon infused batter, which basically tastes like cocaine), and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything was served with decent portions, well executed, clean, and very tasty. I found the sourdough waffles to be light and airy, served with strawberries that were sweet but with that hint of tart, so good that i didn't even have to put syrup on my waffles!

Although I found the prices to be a bit steep ($13 for mimosas and champagnes, although try the French 75 and the hibiscus champagne), we got out of there, with gratuity included, for about $40 a person. The entrees themselves are REALLY affordable, under $15 for most dishes (including $12 for french toast or waffles)

I only went to Kaira's because they happened to have the dress I wanted in stock.  The woman who helped me at the first appointment was great and I had a very pleasurable experience, unfortunately it went down hill from there.  Soon I started to understand all of the comments about how disorganized and unprofessional these people are.  Upon leaving, I asked if I could make my final payment over the phone instead of coming in, I was told no which was fine even though it didn't really make sense.  When the time came for me to make the payment I called just to be sure I really had to drive all the way over there, and to my surprise, when the store greeting started playing, there was a ""make a payment"" option!  I made my payment and asked for a receipt to be emailed to me, it never was.

I found, ordered, and paid for my dress in August.  I was told it would be in store mid December.  My wedding was January 30th.  Getting close to the end of December without hearing from them, I decided to call.  ""Your dress will ship on 12/31 and in store on 01/02, when would you like to come in for alterations?""  I said 01/02 of course!  So, one of my bridesmaids and I show up that morning, we are told to wait, and after about 15 minutes go by the ""store owner' comes over and says, ""I'm sorry but I have no record of you having an appointment, your dress isn't even here!""  I tell her about my conversation with the person I made the appointment with, I didn't get a name.  She says they never make alteration appointments without the dress being in store and she has no idea why someone would do so, then she says, ""The only thing I can think of is, one of our girls is pregnant and I don't wanna say 'pregnancy brain' but...""  Yes, blame you and your employee's incompetence on pregnancy brain, I'm a woman so of course I will understand, all I want to do with my life is pop out babies so I will have sympathy.  I DO NOT.  I would have been more satisfied with, ""She's an idiot.""

She tells me the dress will DEFINITELY be there the following week, so I reschedule my appointment.  The day came, my dress was there, and I got my fitting.  There were quite a bit of alterations so I was extremely nervous about time.  At this point, I think I had about three weeks until my wedding day.  Two weeks go by and I hear NOTHING.

He had just started at this location that day.  We were headed to a different mattress store, but we got a little lost and just decided to walk in and see what they had here.

As we walked in, we were greeted by the manager (he was the only staff in the store).  He asked us what we were looking for and we told him.  He actually suggested the Queen Set for $377 + tax.  We also got some good advice about the mattresses and that was helpful. We wanted a slightly lower profile so my mom could more readily get in and out of the bed.  He informed us that they have thinner box springs and showed us the height that the bed would be.  We had mom test it out and see how she felt about the height and the mattress.  

We were also needing a good washable mattress cover, so after some discussion, we chose one.  All three types of their mattress covers are guaranteed and washable.  We were told that it is not recommended to use bleach or fabric softener since it will alter the mattress cover.

Without too much ado, we ordered a set with a metal frame and mattress cover.  We swiped our card, took the bill of sales and were told when the delivery should take place.  The delivery was efficient and quick enough.  It arrived the next day.

Since I am from Los Angeles, CA, I am not sure I will need to buy a mattress in Arizona any time soon.  If I were in the market for another mattress in the vicinity, I would not hesitate to shop here again.",25,s_FAHFKUl4YqNofYZC1NYg

First of all, pho was great. we both liked the broth very much. If you are a fan of Saigon noodles on Odana Rd., you would think the portion is smaller than ones at Saigon noodles. 

We ordered two appetizers(egg rolls and spring rolls). I give 3 stars for egg rolls and 4 for spring rolls.

We ordered a combination fried rice for my son but it was not as good as ones at other Asian restaurants. My son is 4 years old and of course he likes fried rice everywhere but he kinda stopped eating at some point. You might like it if you are a big fan of curry flavor.  

The reason why I am giving this restaurant 3 stars in rating is the service. I was very disappointed with the service that my waiter was giving us.

We decided to share a Ninja size for 5.50 because the Sumo size was pretty big for 7 bucks. Again we were disappointed for the Shinobi Nut was way too sweet. 

If you refer to my pics, they only have 5 different snow cream flavors. I guess I am spoiled by Yougurtland since they have all sorts of different flavors not to mention tart and sugar free options. For those those that are used to froyo, you serve yourself and are charged by weight. These guys put it in one of two sizes you pick and then give it to you. So they charge by size and not by weight. 

So for now it is a solid 3 stars. I will come back again to try the mango and/or the strawberry snow cream. Im hoping its not too sweet either. Don't get me wrong, a little bit of sweetness goes a long way, especially when you are already adding more sugar to it a la gummy bears, chocolate, etc.

EvQZDyoTT2ztVdw6rH3EwA,0,2012-07-28 11:29:19,1,WjJtQEyICdN4WTFgwdhzRA,1,"let me detail my last experience:

I called network automotive on Main St. in mesa for a quote for replacing a part on my vehicle.  I had done my own diagnosis and was confident that the problem would be remedied with this procedure.  On this call they took down the information and said they would call me back with a quote.  They did return my call later that day and left a message saying to give them a call back.

I called them back the next day and received a quote that seemed reasonable given the labor rate, and the price that I could find the part for.  I made an appointment for the next day at 8:00 am.  I was under them impression that the part was already ordered considering I was a return customer, and I had an appointment set. 

I arrived right at 8am to have the procedure done.  I handed my keys to the person at the desk and proceeded to wait.  What I saw happen next was that my truck was pulled into the back corner angled away from me, the hood put up, and not one person went near my vehicle for an hour and a half.  At around 9:30 I asked them if I should bring it back at a more convenient time.  They said they receieved the wrong part from the parts supplier.  I just looked at the person expecting him to tell me the correct part was on the way and he didn't; rather, he asked, and I quote, ""why do you want to replace that part?  I've never had to replace that part before.""  I must remind you that on the first phone call I explained to them exactly what I wanted to have replaced and why.  At this time I explained to him exactly what I had already explained twice already, on the phone.  After I finish he tells me that he can only find the part I need for over 3.5 times the price that I could find it for from Autozone.  As this is all happening the tech has finally decided to pull out the old part, and he comes walking in to the desk area with it, and he says, ""yeah, it's bad.""  This made me think that it took about 2 minutes to get the part out.

All in all, I ended up paying 90% MORE than what they originally quoted me, I paid 125% extra for the part, and paid for 1.5 hours of labor, for a 15 minute job.  I was there right at 8, and was able to roll out at 10:50.

In conclusion I will never take my vehicle back there.  My vehicle is over 10 years old and I maintain it very well, as it is an essential part of my livelyhood.  It's unfortunate that we cannot count on a local business such as this one to take care of the people from the town where they do business.

I see a lot of people that give rave reviews over their alignments, and I'm sure they probably do a good job, but if you need parts, prepare to get GOUGED.",4,ddnOxfqf7FPSFL2lOwOlIw

Went and asked about the ""spa pedicure"" that was listed at $27. I confirmed the price with the woman that greeted me and she said~ yes $27 spa pedicure. The price was compatible to prices at other salons I'd been to, so I went for it. Keeping in mind I was a new walk in client, I wasn't sure what to expect but was hopeful. 

First off the massage chair was having issues. The woman was kind enough to fiddle with it a few times & get it to work, which was awesome. The actual pedicure itself was good. Nothing spectacular, but good. I was pleased, at the time being. The girl doing the pedicure barely said a word to me, but that's totally ok as I was relaxed and enjoying the pampering. 

Now I'd had spa pedicures before at the price range of $25-$30 and they included the usual foot treatments, polish, paraffin.... All in the spa pedicure. Since there usually isn't a breakdown of the service on the price list, you assume you're getting what you pay for right? Well I was clearly wrong.... Instead of $27 plus Tax for the spa pedicure ($30.51) it somehow came to $42.75. Clearly I was confused at the price, only to be told EXTRAS COST EXTRA. Ummm what extras? And why wasn't I told IN ADVANCE that this particular portion was an extra, so I had the option of agreeing to it, or saying no thanks. That's what bothers me, that they did NOT give me an option, nor did they even tell me prior to starting and even during... That it would be an additional cost. That made me feel SCAMMED big time!!!!  I told the woman I'd only agreed to the $27 spa pedicure and even asked her the price before starting. That this extra cost wasn't something I agreed to. She stood there silent waiting for me to pay, so not like I had a choice obviously. I left very annoyed and despite the actual pedicure itself being good, I'd NEVER go back again!!!! 

BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE not telling a new client, that was obviously unfamiliar with services at this salon!!! All it would have taken, was to let me know in advance that this (particular service) was at an additional cost. That's not too much to ask at all!!  Shame I had to give a one star rating, I'd prefer no stars if that was an option!!!

ITS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO AT LEAST OBTAIN 2 OR 3 ESTIMATES PRIOR TO USING PARKER AND SONS. IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO WRITE REVIEWS LIKE THIS.

I went to Home Depot last weekend to purchase two Rheem water heaters. I was advised that Parker and Sons was the company used to install Home Depot water heaters. The technician came to my house this morning, conducted a 5 minute walk through of both existing water heaters then spent 20 minutes in his truck writing an estimate. The estimate was $5,538! When I asked the technician how in the world the price could be so high, he responded, ""that's our pricing on """"our"""" water heaters. I told him this estimate was set up by Home Depot not Parker and Sons. He continued to tell me the pricing was for Parker and Sons water heaters. The water heater from Home Depot was $850 each, how could Parker and Sons charge an additional approx. $2,000 per unit to install? They said it was to bring my current water heater up to code and pull a permit.  I called the city of Scottsdale and they informed me the only cost that would be needed was a water pressure valve ($14) and a permit ($44). The remaining items on my current units are up to code and would easily pass in inspection. Parker and Sons pays it's technicians commission for every job they are on. They will try to increase the price to receive that commission. This is a predatory business practice. Just look at all the reviews on Parker and Sons, they are almost all based on being mislead and over charged.

UPDATE: Angie, please read my entire review prior to responding next time. My main complaint isn't just pricing. I called this estimate through Home Depot to purchase a water heater from Home Depot. The technician quoted me a Parker and Sons water heater based on Parker and Sons pricing, not Home Depot pricing. There is no need to have a supervisor call me. I've already spoken with Paul Kelly, owner of Parker and Sons this morning.  I will leave our conversation of the review but I can assure everyone reading this review that I addressed my concern regarding the technician and company of this predatory business practice. He assured me he will investigate and follow up with me. 

UPDATE: I just received an estimate to install from Huntington Home Improvement for $750, all parts and haul away of both old units included.",8,I8zSO_iKzCZgdJ0CtY42Yw

Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it
Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. 

There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. 

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it. 

I also feel it's one of the finer values on the Strip as far as cost. ~$15pp for the best breakfast you're likely to ever have is a bargain",1,ks7yFvUxYK0R7TFOam3-KA

 I asked them why they aren't making REAL Cronuts, and they admitted its just a deep fried croissant rolled in cinommon & sugar....they said that NYC isn't the inventor it was invented in France and this is how they make the the 'original' way!

I researched and could not find ANY references to Cronuts or Kronuts other than NYC!
But the NYC is different than Just a Crossiant fried & rolled in sugar & cinnomon, Although Cronut does tend to use the dough (or similar to ) of a croissant but its higher because you do more folds with the Cronut than on a croissant and also tend to put some kind of filling and special toppings to compliment it


well... check this out, NYC did invent the Cronut!

He also said nobody has complained!!! I guess they don't watch the internet for feedback because there were many on just Yelp! alone that complained about the ""cronuts"" they have!

So Fourth Ward Bread Co. takes a very small croissant, deep fries it and rolls it in cinnomon & sugar charging $3.00 for one!
Yet they have their very nice size croissant plain 3 times bigger for $2.99.

And most things are over priced! I mean come-on! $9.00 for a Tomato & Lettuce croissant only because it's the ""Special Sandwiches"" for the day?!!

For anything else, I'd have to go with 3. Despite having one of the best beer selections in town, I don't think I'd hang out here all night - just not comfy enough. Lots of tables, cramped, bar is super open, noisy, kids everywhere, eh. Everything we had other than pie was so-so as well - Pasta special (primavera penne) was very standard. Jalapeno poppers (I know I know) were all breading, no spice, and filled with velveeta. For 7 bucks, at a good pizza joint, I expected more. I also found it surprising how little garlic adorned our order of 8 garlic knots. Tasted like we were eating dinner rolls.

But the pizza was goooood. Not a crust style I've ever been in love with in the past, but can come to love, I think - sweet, whole wheat-y, soft. For me, this means I'll be getting gorgonzola on every pizza I order to contrast the sweetness of the crust, but that's fine.

This company came to my home to evaluate AC air flow problems this past summer. 

They told me I needed a new air conditioner within 10 minutes of coming in my house. They refused to get into the sticks to check duct work and did not even analyze the AC unit first. They where sent by American Home Shield who I have dropped. They are a rip off just like Air Command!!!

The service Rep was supposed to  send a smaller guy back the next morning to check our duct work when it was cooler. They never showed and refused to come back but where very happy to charge me 2; 75.00 service call fees per American Home Shield. FYI. It was a duct problem and NOT THE AC!!!

   Long version:                                         
  I went to Place of Clay.  I was greeted first by a small chihuahua then Lino.  Lino came out of his office, smiled warmly, and asked if he could help.  He told us about Saltillo, it's care, and application.  He then took time to walk us through his large lot of tile.  We were not quite ready, but mentioned we were coming this way on Saturday for a hike.  His eyes lit up and he told us several good hiking spots.  He was friendly even with us leaving.

We did return to purchase our tile at Place of Clay.  We also took Lino's suggestion for a tile contractor.    The contractor was amazing.  He had practical and creative ideas yet, and made sure we were happy with each step. Daniel also made sure we could comfortably live while our entire house was tiled.  His experience and careful cleanup made the process go smoothly.  The house turned out amazing!  

I loved being able to select my tile.  Lino knew I wanted a few paw prints, various sizes, shapes, manganese Saltillo, and also tile with high levels of variation.  He went through all his tile and found my perfect lots.  We purchased tile for our entire home and patio. 

One may enter and see a rustic patio with a seemingly chaotic piles of boxes. ( I believe another viewer took a picture. ) Do not let those dusty piles fool you!  They are a treasure trove of  talvera tile.   I did a mosaic wall in my house and was able to find pieces no longer in production.  He truly has the best selection in town of artistic talvera.  He also has the georgous Santa Barbara tile!  I used Santa Barbara for each entry way in my home.  The price for the Santa Barbara  tile was four dollars a tile.  Other shops sold it for seven dollars a tile! Other items that you might enjoy include sinks, talvera animals, and many types of concrete planters.   I also ordered a couple planters as his price was excellent!

To end..go here!  I am so glad I did.",2,HcpKcDUHalSJJ_5I-ighvA

I've been there three times now and I can't really say there's anything bad about this place, but let's just say it's not for the faint-of-heart.

It's probably my fault for not communicating more, but Tony takes over without a lot of discussion and let's just say I break a sweat every time I sit there wondering how it's going to turn out. One time I asked for ""light layers"" and when I got home I felt that I wanted more so I went back and he cleaned up the layers free of charge which I thought was very nice (Yesterday he went a little heavy on the layers and unfortunately I can't go back and ask him to glue the hair back on- oh well).

The younger gentlemen are really friendly and know how to cut hair.  The older gentleman they refer to as ""Abba"" (so I guess he's somebody's dad?), not so much.  I've been coming here for years, but in the last few months, Abba has sort of ""claimed"" me as his client.  Which was ok, because he did give me decent haircuts.  Except for the last 2 visits he started getting passive-aggressive with me.  Asking me if I were ""lazy"" because I hadn't been in in a while.  No, actually, I was unemployed and trying to save money.   Another bit of attitude today--which I didn't really pick up on at first because of the language barrier.  But the final straw was the massacre he conducted on my neck, which should be fairly evident from my posted picture.

I have never been the type to go gaga over engagement rings and I'm not a fan of the huge monstrosities that a lot of women find beautiful.  In my mind I was perfectly content with just having a beautiful wedding band.  My now fiance of course wanted me to have something as a symbol of our engagement so I thought it over and decided why not? When I decided that I was ok with an engagement ring I knew that I didn't want a ton of money to be spent on it. Since I can be a bit of a control freak, I took the reigns and started looking for my own engagement ring :) I searched Craigslist and other online sites looking for previously owned pieces before venturing out to the stores. I never thought that I would want an engagement ring from a ""mall"" store but hey, sometimes life works out in unexpected ways. 

Our first stop on our engagement ring hunt was the Zales Outlet. Sandra was our sales person and she was awesome. I knew that I didn't want a traditional ring and beyond that I was really open to whatever. She was so patient and genuinely seemed to have fun showing me a bunch of different styles. The very first ring that she showed me was the ring I ultimately ended up with. Looking back on it it was like she knew my style right away. Of course since I am an over analyzer I had to go look at other stores and try on more rings before making my decision. Not once did Sandra pressure us into making the sale. I cannot say enough how much I appreciated her patience.  

When we went back to purchase Sandra was gone for the day but the store manager rang the sale for her and took good care of us. The process was painless and I left with an uniquely perfect engagement ring!",5,SdotQsXyVenKeV0SI8AtDA

Took my F250 in for AC maint. Excellent job. Fast and efficient. 
 3 weeks later I took my truck in again for electrical problems with power windows and the door ajar light was always on. And the radio didn't work.
 All fixed quickly and reasonably priced. Also told them I needed brakes and shocks. They checked them out. Turns out I didn't need either. That saved me money. 
 That kind of honesty will bring me back every time. Paula, Phil and Butch all treated
me with courtesy and respect. Good people. They got themselves a permanent customer !",2,g9_qh30_3Y9ynRbQQf7MgQ

A couple friends and I sat down at a table surrounded by beautiful paintings suspended from the ceiling. We sampled all varieties, including the spectacular Nightcall smoked porter and Silk Scorpion Black IPA. Having never tasted a porter, I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised by its flavor and pleasant aroma. Additionally, my friends and I tried a few menu items including a summer sausage sandwich and the homemade pretzel. Both were excellent. I recommend Karben 4 to all beer drinkers, period. One more thing, the music played in the taproom was excellent. It wasn't too loud, and I was still able to hold conversations without shouting at the top of my lungs.

This will be some of the best Thai food in the city if you're not extremely picky.  I've seen some complaints here from people who claim it's overhyped, but I wonder if it's fair to judge this place so harshly.  Their food is VERY good compared to almost all the other Thai food I've had in the city, but you also have to consider that it's relatively cheap as well.  The value you get for the price is exceptional.  I really do recommend it if you're looking for some yummy thai on a budget - and in an area not known for it's thai cuisine.  My only complaint is that the chairs at the table are not very comfortable - they almost look like metal patio chairs.  Other than that, all good.

I've had their pad thai (which is delicious - more of a satay pad thai than the horrible shit you normally get in the city that tastes like it's half ketchup) as well as the curry, which is really yummy and made properly with coconut milk (instead of the watery kind you can get sometimes).

the starter ceaser salad was more palatable of lettuce than the dressing.  ive had better ones.  wine list was pretty good.

our entreés consisted of the 12 oz ny strip steak along with a rice/veggie pilaf and some sort of chicken dish with mashed potatoes.  i requested the steak medium well and it tasted well done...very chewy and burnt in some spots.  the chicken was very good from the few bites i had.

Dealing with this place is like going through a contract a lot of ammendments.

* no bill splitting
* gratuity is included with the price (so they can get away with bad service)
* only one round for appetizer and dessert
* different prices for vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
* we bring the food to you rather than you picking it yourself in the portion we choose
* we will bring the food whenever we feel like and make arbitrary choices like waiting for the full party to arrive without checking on whether the main bulk of the party is already ready anyway.

After what felt like forever which is about 30 minutes after arrival is when they started asking what we want to get.

I chose the non-vegetarian option, though they only had two dishes that are non-vegetarian and they're both chicken.  The appetizer which only had one round had some chicken dish which wasn't too bad.  The mains only had butter chicken (which is close but relatively of lower par than that of India Sweets).

In typical Indian style, most of their food had a bit of heat, but they were pretty tolerable even for myself so I did enjoy eating a few of their food.  Some of the veggie dishes were pretty good.

However, I don't normally get myself full, unless the food is bad or disagrees with me.  The food probably disagreed with me and a few of my colleagues.  It had the same feeling as a cheap Mandarin buffet which puts ingredients to make you feel full and leave ASAP.  I had to waste eating the left over dessert and I hate wasting food.

Near the end of the terrible service ordeal, the waitress says to the person who was coordinating the payments that we do not split the bills and we already tack on the gratuity as it to add insult to injury.

I only gave this a two star because some of the food made up for the minus 4 star service.  And I won't recommend this place to anyone.  How it even got those awards I can just speculate that they must've paid someone off or they knew the reviewer was arriving.",3,yeX7tzZZWCnphQifRJglUg

I just about always get the Jade Red Chicken in a Burrito and then either Machata, Carnitas or Emerald Chicken in a Quesadilla. Their Black Beans + Jerk Fried Rice as the side choices is to die for, especially mixed together. This isn't to say that any of the selections aren't excellent; I've tried just about everything and there was nothing I didn't like. A million times better than Panda Express.

Ordering is confusing for newbies but once you get the hang of it, you'll prefer it to any other form of ordering because it actually speeds things up if the customers know what they're doing. And for the customers that are confused, if they just walk up to the counter with a confused look, there's always an employee that will move to the side, explain the ordering, and give samples of the most popular items.

All hail Chinos! Here's hoping they franchise and/or continue to expand. I seriously think if the owners took a plunge or accepted investment opportunity, this could be a successful national chain. Especially if the investors provided some advice on improving the ordering and aesthetic of the restaurants, which is just about the only downside (and only a surface one).

I used to love this restaurant because the portions were large, generous amount of meat & rich flavouring. Unfortunately it is not the case anymore. Portions are small (I could finish it at one sitting...normally I need to bring half home). I ordered the Pollo Pesto & they  have since eliminated the cream sauce from before.  You must ask for it ( what?!). Even when u ask for it, the cream sauce is all watered down. Honestly...I could have made this at home.

They are probably advertising this as the new healthy approach. However, if I have to pay close to $20 for a small pasta it's just not worth the time. Stay home & cook it or go somewhere else.

People post positive reviews here, and that's great. However, here's my rather different experience. 

Went to one artist, who loves Star Trek and has a bald head. Should I say his name or is that too much? Ok. I'll say his name. Smitty... He was supposed to do the tat in ONE sitting for a set price. He finishes apx 1/2, then tells me that I have to come back and pay more. This didn't bother me because he did such a great job (THE FIRST TIME ONLY, it turns out). The (first) tattoo is asymmetrical, jetted out on the edges, is supposed to look like a pattern coming out of the skin. It's a very specific concept and design, and there really is no mystery to what it is or isn't.

When I go back to get the piece completed, he had TWO things:

1) the original print out of the concept/design right next to him 
2) the piece that HE HIMSELF did on the front of my foot/ankle!

On the second visit, the piece was done as I lay on my stomach, on the back of my ankle/leg, outside of my vision. If I could have seen what he was doing, and knew the direction that he was going in, I definitely would have said something to halt the process or switch directions.

The second sitting looks absolutely nothing like the first! ITS UGLY. It looks like a blob, a block. The pattern is simply crammed together thoughtlessly in a blocked blob. It's like he paid attention to detail/design the first time, and the second time he didn't give a flying flick... It's not a lack of competency, it's a lack of thought and it's carelessness. Rushed, only thinking about the dollar perhaps? But with all the work that I'm going to end up getting, it's best to be long term greedy and actually care about the consistency of the design. 

I ended up paying 166% of the original quoted price, PLUS tip, for the reason stated in the 3rd paragraph/segment... so why not take time to care? It's not like I'm not paying you or tipping you. It's not like you've seen me act like uber B__ch, like how I feel like acting now! It's not like I wasn't polite or cordial at the time... Why put something rushed thoughtless and ugly, that looks absolutely nothing like the first beautiful piece, when it was supposed to be an extension of the first?

If there are 20 ways to do one thing, don't take the quickest, most basic, easiest, (and in this case, ugliest) route without checking with the person who has to end up dealing with it. If there's some confusion on the artist's part, it's best to ask what the client wants. If I knew I had to micromanage, I gladly would have done so. As stated above, HE HAD NOT ONE, BUT TWO SPECIFIC IMAGES TO WORK FROM. TWO! 

It's costly and time consuming to get a tattoo removed. Not only does it hurt like a mother-f when getting laser on a bone, but it costs $$$, and you have to wait maybe 6 weeks (?) between laser treatments. So it's months worth of time, more money, and needless pain.

Am I pissed the f off? Yes! If it was an easy repair, I wouldn't be as mad. But it's literally a block/blob, instead of skin showing within the design and this very specific concept. I've been staring at it, trying to figure out a way how to morph it into something else or make it look not so UGLY, and I can't come up with anything except removal. 

Tattoos are supposed to be beautiful. Its art. And if you use your look for your business, have to get a photo shoot done, whatever the case may be, it's even more infuriating. People don't know what media work a person may do, or what publications that they're in... nor do they need to know.... so why assume that the look doesn't have a high level of value IN A BUSINESS/ PROFESSIONAL SENSE??? If you're paying money, the work should be treated like it's going to be showcased in a high level magazine. Not treated like you're going to settle for less, or have no taste. It's tasteless. It's like walking into a poorly designed room with old raggedly furniture. In contrast to a room sleek and modern, with high attention to detail. 

I could write 5 books on this. I could post pictures too. But I'm going to leave it at that.

Granted, we did not have the standard experience as we came on Christmas Eve, but the staff was friendly and warm. As we watched food being served, it seemed the same dishes kept coming up over and over again, which is good since our rookie order overlapped:

- Tuscan Legume Soup ($8): Enjoyable but otherwise unremarkable.
- Mozzarella Caprese ($13): Sized for two and executed excellently.
- Fish Roulade ($29): Special of the evening was fish rolled with crab and lobster meat over spinach with lobster ravioli. How can one go wrong? One can't.
- Scampi Caprese & Lobster Ravioli ($28): I'd call this a miss but I'm in the minority as my parents both enjoyed it and most of the restaurant seemed to agree.
- The Best Lasagna Ever ($24): A bold claim, but this really was the best lasagna I've had in a very long time - balanced flavors and not too heavy.

For dessert, an adequate tiramisu was heavily overshadowed in both size and preference by a monster cannoli. 

Tomaso's is a little on the expensive side but one is clearly paying for quality of atmosphere, service and food. It meets the difficult bar of somewhere on which both my meat and potatoes parents and I can agree. For a special occasion (or on an expense account) I'd definitely drop in again.",4,m_ZofG4UObEMBND2vdyiwg

My husband is a Veteran and I work in healthcare. the VA Health System in Las Vegas, NV  is impressive!!! The hospital in North LV, is huge! The parking lot has many signs and the layout was very intentional, with lots specific to buildings. The landscape is very nice too! The inside of the hospital is huge! It looks like a giant mall! There are lots of clearly marked, signs to help guests navigate through the hospital. I could not get lost! I've worked at several hospitals, and the VA Hospital has been the best with its signage. I also noticed the use of modern technology, monitors everywhere, a numbering system to get a 1:1 time with a Pharmacist.  Some of the hallways have a pulley system for patients who can't walk, to carry them in the air throughout the hospital. The care teams have been wonderful! Then of course, there is the VA Southwest Clinic. Just the fact that there is a second option (and closer to our home) where my husband can see a PCP, do labs, and join programs is SO important! There is no way a Veteran can miss an appointment, because a post card gets mailed, calls are made, emails are sent, and the best part- when a Veteran goes to his appointment, he gets a print out of the upcoming appointments. I can go on- I do realize some VA systems are not this fancy & efficient. But we feel so blessed with the VA in Las Vegas. I know how lucky we are to have 2 VA health systems in Las Vegas, so tele-health in rural areas for Veterans will help tremendously!",0,CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg

I was really excited to find another soul food resturaunt because they are so hard to find in Arizona and it's down the street from work so that even sweetened the pot. I'm basically going to list the pros and cons of this place.

Pros: 
-Free/ convenient parking
-Quality food 4/5 ( 4 because my fried pork chop was SUPER salty and my neck bones were not seasoned enough)
- Very friendly staff
- small mom and pop restaurant ( not a chain, so the location still has that homey feeling)

Cons:
-SERVICE ( there is something DEFINITELY left to be desired)- I've been here twice and both times my order was made incorrectly... 1) a coworker and I placed an order.. we pick it up to find they placed my fried pork chop with her sides and her smothered pork chop with my sides. Instead of offering to fix it, they told us to just swap everything around ourselves. So messy! 2) I ordered neck bones with cabbage and yams as a side and a separate side of yams for someone else. I pick it up and there are 2 sides of yams in my container...keep in mind one was for someone else. Before fixing it the argued back and fourth a bit and asked me if I clarified over the phone that it was for someone else....I DID, I even asked her if she understood to put it in separate containers and she said yes. Obviously not. 

-somewhat over priced.

All in all I really want to support this place... a homeless man around 19, walked in and said he was down on his luck and wanted to know if they could help him out. The owner (I'm guessing) told him to have a seat, she asked what he wanted to drink, went to the kitchen and returned with a full plate of food for him. It's not often that people express this amount of kindness for someone that can't do anything for them in return. 

So I would give the food a solid 4 and the service a 3...making that a 3.5...but since 1/2's don't exist on yelp I will give it a 4. With better service this place could be amazing!",6,vCNi_1IjJKFc-ih07FdEbw

Second, Dr. Patel seems to be more abreast of current scientific and medical research, sharing new findings versus some practitioners who continue to spew the 30 year old research they learned in medical school. Lastly, and this is my favorite, if Dr. Patel doesn't know about something (and lets be real, doctors are almost always making educated guesses), he's not going to give you a b******* answer.

HOLY COW!  That's awesome.  Even though we had it delivered the next day, we were very impressed with the same day delivery option.

Michael Christie was our guy, he was knowledgable and professional.  Not a salesy type of guy and we liked that about him.  

There were many options to choose from in all price ranges.  As we were matress shopping, we found it a bit odd to be laying around on different mattresses in public and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each one-- but in Mattress Firm, it wasn't as odd feeling as some of the other stores we hit up that day.

Buying a new mattress feels like the best thing we have done in a long time.... the one we picked out is AWESOME so far.  The price is pretty hard to beat BUT if we see that exact same mattress for a cheaper price at their store or any other store, they will refund the difference PLUS 10%.  

The delivery guys set it up in less than 15 minutes and gave us the 5-8pm time slot and arrived just a bit after 5pm-- loved that.  I hate sitting around and waiting and waiting.

If all goes well, we won't need to buy a new one in at least 15 years so let's hope I don't review another mattress store until then.

BTW, the Heavenly Bed knock off is a Simmons Beautyrest Classic.  They say it is the same bed but without the Westin tags on it.  We got the upgraded one for a bit more firmness and the pillowtop.  I want to lay on it all day.

~The Good~
The vegetable selection is out of this world. So many varieties, its hard to list them all. They offer Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) at the lowest prices in the valley. LOVE IT! So many different cabbages, and so on...I could go on and on. The meat selection looks good as well, especially the seafood, which has a ton of different fishes. The sake and Asian wine selections is also really cool, right above the frozen food beds filled with yummy frozen seafood.  The noodle and rice section, as expected, is overwhelming and filled with great choices. The sauces section is also huge, you forget sometimes how many sauces are featured in Asian cooking. Finally, I do not eat any baked goods normally, but the bakery looks really good. If I did eat treats on a normal basis, I'd come here.

~The Bad~
With the good comes the bad, especially the unsightly open tanks filled with the fish and seafood. It smells ""interesting"" in the meat/seafood section, hence the reason I usually do not get anything there. The fish are almost always sold whole....I prefer pre-cut, personally. I also do have a hard time with the sheer enormity of all the goods, most of them without much descriptions. I really have to do my homework either WHILE shopping or BEFORE shopping, or I will be buying something I have no clue about. It is an adventure, shopping here, nonetheless.

~The Down Low~
This place really is a 3.5 out of 5. 2 stars go out for the sheer amount of specialty Asian foods to select from, and another for the sake/beer selection....more than anywhere else in the valley. A 1/2 star goes out to the seafood selection, omitting some stars for the previously discussed issues I have with the meat/seafood section. Come here for anything food-wise you could want from Asia...just expect a wild trip going through the aisles, and remember to come prepared!",4,sOZfGLRjhcEjAKBLZKcJGg

In terms of lunch dishes, there are a couple of sandwich options (falafel, chicken salad) and either chilli or a soup option. There is also a salad bar and the prices are again pretty reasonable. Everything is tasty but basic, so don't expect it to knock your socks off.

There is plenty of seating inside and the owner's $5 banana loaf is perfect to bring back to work and share with your colleagues. Definitely not the best lunch you'll ever have, but the prices are very reasonable and the service is so good you'll keep coming back!

As for the service, I'll admit they are fairly quick to churn out the customers, although they do look a bit flustered trying to find a vehicle for people and getting them processed. 

My main gripe is the fact that I've rented a vehicle from them twice, and both times the vehicles were not cleaned. I like to use the center console/arm rest to put my stuff in and both times, when opened, there was some nasty garbage in there. Some used napkins, coffee stained rag, crumpled papers. You'd think they would clean these areas out first? First rental also had a bunch of animal hair throughout the vehicle, so I feel bad for anyone with allergies. Exterior was not washed either.

The place was not to crowded for a Saturday night so I was a little surprised to be ignored. Finally the tall guy with dark hair came and acknowledged us, served the beers and provided the bill since we were only there for one round. Pretty decent guy. $18 bar tab so I figured I would put $5 on for tip. 

No sooner do I lay the pen down then the Mr. Rude Dude bald goatee bartender grabs it and rings it out. No acknowledgement whatsoever when taking or seeing the tip. He goes about his way to then help the next group. I could over hear the conversation and whatever the woman ordered he said, ""how about the Apple Cider"" which was some drink on tap....""it is easier to make than the drink"". Sounding a bit on the lazy side if you ask me.

Now don't get me wrong, I know that places like this pool their tips, but it annoys the hell out of me to put a little extra down in the tip area for the person that served you all to have someone else take the tab away and the original person having no idea of your generosity. Freaking Rude.

Food quality was very good here, the only thing that didn't look fresh to me was a couple of fish dishes and fish almost never looks fresh.  Our favorite dishes were the Korean Short Ribs, Pork loin, super sweet corn on the cob and sweet corn chowder.  The lychee ice cream was also a hit for me with real pieces of lychee in the yummy ice cream.  There wasn't much seafood or expensive cuts of meat available for lunch (no prime rib) but the prices were pretty reasonable.   Lunch was $27 and dinner is $40.  The Friday Seafood dinner is $50 which is pretty darn cheap for a high end Vegas buffet.

To some people pets are property, to others friends and family members.  To me...well I probably had what some might consider an ""unhealthy"" relationship with my cat, Jasper, whom my husband later so crudely dubbed ""The Big Sexy.""  But Jasper had been with me for more than 16 years, my husband only 8.  Who would you expect to have the highest rank in the house?

It was somewhat of a last minute decision to handle Jasper's final arrangements ourselves, rather than using the service provided by our veterinarian.  And I'm glad that we did.  I was impressed with the services Fairwinds offers. Their focus is as much on those ""surviving"" the loss, as well as the pet.  

Mary and Fairwinds are available to retrieve your pet valley-wide 24/7.  You may also bring your pet to them (no charge during regular business hours).  Fairwinds' services range from just the cremation to a clergy-presided service, and everything in between.   Mary will gladly accommodate special requests as well (paw impressions for example). 

We opted to take the Sexy in ourselves, and were warmly greeted by Mary and two new friends of the canine variety.  They were blissfully unaware that funeral homes are to be quiet, yet they were oddly comforting, especially to my husband who has always been a dog person.

All cremations are not only individual, but private as well (meaning only one animal at a time is cremated).  There are procedures in place upon your pet's arrival to ensure there are no mix-ups either.  I was 100% confident I would not be crying over a little bit of my Mr Man and a little bit of someone's schnauzer.  The website lists the pricing, but you can also choose just the services important to you, and not a ""package."" 

Mary handled the details professionally and personally.  It is clear she has a deep understanding of the bond some of us have with our pets, and she does everything she can to respect that bond.  Jasper's ashes were ready within 2 days.  We were given our keepsakes, a big hug, and resources should I need some serious therapy.  

So yes, Mary is ""as good as it gets.""  I hope my fellow Yelpers don't need to use her services, but she will be there if you do.",17,Rzf35jKV8e8EJdssrae_AA

After having lived in L.A. the past two years I guess I figured that trendy restaurants = mediocre food and lousy service from snooty, pretentious wanna-be actors.
I was definitely in for a surprise.
The waiter was awesome! Friendly, attentive without being annoying, great at making suggestions. 
He recommended that I have the Fez burger. I was a little apprehensive about it though, I mean a spicy honey molasses bbq with cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro? Nothing seemed like it went together, but it was wonderful. Sweet, a little spicy, a little garlic-y. 
The only thing that was so-so was the garlic rosemary fries. They were a little too cooked and the flavor was a bit too strong. I think next time I will try the sweet potato fries.

The people who work here are runners themselves and are trained to look at the wear patterns of your old running shoes (if you're already a runner or walker, bring your last pair of shoes!), as well as your gait on a treadmill, to determine what your needs are in a running shoe.  They don't offer computerized gait analysis, but that's pretty much the only thing they DON'T do when they're fitting you for a pair of running shoes.  They're also pretty rigorous about making sure that you're in the correct size of shoe for your feet, which some local places don't take all that much trouble to check.  Plus, you can take shoes out into the parking lot for a brief test run, which I find better than testing shoes on the treadmill (95% of my running is out on the street, so...)

I run about 20-25 miles per week, and I have some biomechanical idiosyncrasies that can easily lead to my getting hurt if I'm not in the right shoes.  Elite has done a great job of putting me in appropriate shoes so far.  They're understanding if cost is a bit of a factor in your decision, and I trust that they're looking to make sure your needs are met rather than trying to sell you the most-expensive shoe in the store.  So don't be the jerk who goes there, spends an hour getting fitted and testing out different models, and then leaves and buys the shoes on the Internet to save $20.

1. Great facilities...we chose this over LA Fitness which is closer to our house because we wanted the steam room...
2. Usually no waiting on classes or machines at any time we have been there...
3. Staff is mostly friendly and Club Manager personally spoke with us to help resolve some of the issues below....
4. 2 hot tubs, so one is always open..other clubs seem to close it when I want it most..also  steam and dry sauna are very well maintained...I wish they were coed, but despite being in the locker-room, they require bathing suits anyway so I'm not sure why my wife and I have to split up to go in them...it tends to shorten our use...
5. they have good towel service for no extra cost

Now the negatives:
1.  soap/shower gel in shower area is poor...need a better gel/body wash
2. install ""rain heads"" in at least a few of the showers like 24 hour fitness...
3. locker room is trashed at 5AM..wet towels everywhere on floor...obvious night staff doesn't clean it up
4. there was SO MUCH the membership people didn't tell us during our signup....ASK ABOUT THE SMALL PRINT:
 a.  was given one week guest pass and NOT told guests can't come in till 9am until I got there at 0500 before work!
 b. Was told we could get 50 minute massage for $20 for first 30 days.  Was NOT told you have to AKS for the special NEW BEGINNINGS deal and actually had to cancel a 30 minute $40 massage after we arrived...then we were told that they DIDN""T GIVE THE CHEAPER MASSAGES ON FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AND THEY WERE BOOKING 13 DAYS OUT FOR THOSE......none of which we were told when we called to schedule or when we arrived...very embarrassing.  in Marketing, that's called BAIT AND SWITCH OR FRAUD for short....
 c. Lastly, the FREE MyLTF bucks they promised EXPIRE in 30 days, so we quickly decided to use them for personal training...what we got was a high pressure SALES PITCH that rivaled ANY TIME SHARE PRESENTATION I've ever been to...we walked out after being told we needed to pay for ""advanced VO2 testing, pay for a Nutritionist, and that our 4 free sessions wouldn't be enough to orient my wife with the machines because ""they were used for basic teaching "" and there was too much information she needed to know first before they could get to the workout....we specifically told them we wanted to use all 4 sessions to set up a workout plan for her (we are both experienced gym members and have used training before).  We were again told that what WE wanted would take PAID sessions and then told that OUR GOALS WERE UNREALISTIC AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO SET A MORE REALISTIC GOAL FOR US.  We were also told that the FITNESS TEST, which was offered as a FREE BENEFIT during our signup by our membership coordinator, would COST US ONE TRAINING SESSION...When I argued that that was not the deal they told us, he said ""Well why didn't your membership guy schedule it then?""  We don't have children in swim lessons and with a  30 day expiration date, these MyLTF Bucks are basically worthless to us...the spa is much more expensive than we would use for services like haircuts, nails, etc.  If you just want a gym to work out at, go to this club...if you plan on using services and LIKE HIGH PRESSURE, CANNED USED CAR-TYPE SALES PITCHES go to this club .....

Loved the opportunity to try three different of their signature drinks!  The baby back ribs were great and the brisket was good too.  We all loved the mash potatoes and gravy.  Unfortunately, they did have areas that needed improvement.  The mac and cheese, cole slaw, and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The corn bread needed a little something extra to give it some flavor.  I recommend adding some jalepeno flavoring and serving in mini iron skillets.

I paid approximately $60 for all-you-can-eat weekend brunch, without booze. As much as I love a good mimosa, I didn't want to fill up on liquid. We were here for food and we meant business. 
Reasons why I felt I got the full value of that $60 meal:
1. I went for the seafood first. You know that stuff is expensive and it is much less common in my life than some white or red meat. This means King crab legs, Cajun shrimp and grits, green mussels, lobster bisque, lox bagel  and lobster eggs benedict. Yes, I did eat all that.
2. The dishes are constantly being replaced with other dishes. I walked around 3/4 of the buffet every time I got another plate because where there was oatmeal and grits, there is now biscuits and gravy. Keep your eyes open and make sure to grab the things you really want before they're gone (they'll probably come back again but will you have space in your stomach by then? Doubtful).
3. Fancy cheeses and charcuterie! I made myself a personal plate that would cost at least $20 as an appetizer anywhere. Just take a slice of each. Remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Oh and they had fresh honey and jams too! My cheese plate round was FANCY.
4. If you do have enough room to eat some more after you hit the best stuff, go for the classics. I got a slice of prime rib, huevos rancheros, Mac & cheese, and fried chicken. Again, take small pieces because you're going to want to try it all!

Two things I will say that go beyond how delicious the food was: I wish one alcoholic beverage was included. No I don't want bottomless mimosas for $15 but yes I would like one. Cheers. Second comment is the crepe line was hella long and only got longer. We were lucky and got in before the major crowds come (the difference between 10:50am and 11am, folks). Only one person makes crepes on two burners. Each takes a good minute or two. Do the math, it's going to be a wait. If you want a crepe, even for later, go if there isn't too much of a line. Or don't go at all. They looked really good but I wasn't willing to wait ~20 minutes.

Overall, delish. I'm very happy with my six rounds of food and wouldn't change a thing (except to get ONE mimosa if they ever decide to offer that).",2,8ahrzebmEdp8NASJom9Izw

Purchase your shoes and take them back to the shoe counter- they'll stretch them for you for 24 hours at no charge.

The rest of the merch is pretty hit or miss. I sometimes find great bargains on handbags and jewelry but the makeup and bath items tend not to be priced very well (pretty average, not really ""outlet pricing"" on those items). You never know what you will find for clothes, sometimes things seem picked through, but once in a while you can really find a designer bargain. Highly recommended!",1,sYauKfRBquRxDwHA1a8EsA

I now usually see Dr. Christiansen at the Pecos office - although I have seen Jensen and at least one other doctor for various reasons and have always had a good experience.. I have always made an effort to see ophthalmologist as opposed to optometrists, but I feel like the exams are very thorough and so I feel no need to see anyone else at this time. I have very poor vision and wear both gas permeable contacts and glasses. The glasses are on the pricey side even with insurance, but they are very good quality. Both of my children also now see Dr. Christiansen. 

I had an emergency situation a few years ago and was able to get in immediately and be seen after my internist told me to go to see an eye dr. ASAP and not only was the exam very thorough, as always, Dr. Christiansen explained everything to me in great detail.

I highly recommend ClearVision Eye Centers!",3,COsNDeSZWlvRWT4_8FatUg

I could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.

After being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.

Turns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and ""natural"" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by "" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills"" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)

When we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?

Ok, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.

I can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!

10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!!

I asked for a basic oil change and an estimate to repair the passenger's side windshield wiper. I was told fixing the wiper required ""blowing the whole thing up"" to replace one pin. That would be an hour's worth of labor: $125 for the windshield wiper repair only (not including the oil change). It may cost more ""when they got in there"". They also told me the battery tested very weak, running at about 36%.

I searched You Tube for how to replace the windshield wiper pin for my specific make and model. Every video was less than 7 minutes. Some were only 3 minutes. 7 minutes of work costs $125? Yeah right.

Knowing that the battery was still under warranty at Auto Zone and replacing one little pin on the windshield wiper didn't take anywhere close to an hour to replace, I told them I didn't have time to wait. Suddenly, the repair would ""only take a few minutes "", but presumably still cost $125. I paid for the oil change and left.

Guess what happened next? After driving a mile, I discovered they disconnected the *driver's* side windshield wiper. It had been working fine when I originally drove it on the lot. It was pouring rain, so I went back and told him his guys disconnected the working wiper and didn't reconnect it. Now, it didn't work at all. ""That's strange,"" he replied. ""Yes, it is, since it had been working fine for months,"" I responded. They reconnected it, only to have it disconnect again a few miles down the road.

When I went to Auto Zone, I watched him test my battery and I saw the results. Guess what?  It was running at 96%. That's another $150 Big O tried to bamboozle me out of.

Like the other reviews say (check the ones that aren't recommended too) this place is a disaster in disrepair (ex. unfixed broken fences in paddocks, doors don't shut/lock properly) and his messy with waste (stalls are wet and not mucked to be dry).

Long & Qua:

I decided to hit Qua after looking out at the pool at Caesars and seeing it swarming with people.  I didn't feel like fighting for a chair out there so I went into Qua and got a day pass.  It wasn't nearly as crowded as the pool but for a Spa, it was pretty crowded.  

Qua is big inside and has at least 5 hot tubs in the mens area.  There are also 2 steam rooms, a dry sauna, and the famous arctic room (my favorite).  There is also the lounge area with TV and chairs, bevs, fruit, etc.  

One of the other things I liked were the heated stone lounge chairs.  I could've relaxed in one all day, but they need to turn the heat up on them.

I didn't get a massage when I went to Qua.  I was discouraged because they don't waive the $40 day spa fee if you get a full service.  That's a little lame if you ask me.  

The only reason Qua doesn't get 5 stars is because there is no outdoor area.  Can someone, ANYONE please make a spa that also has a large outdoor area to lounge at?  Glen Ivy in CA still has everyone beat on that one.

The special show, ""Fire and Ice"" was charming and the interactive stations in the Maker Space were definitely the biggest hit with the girls (even if the supplies were running woefully low)! They also enjoyed the interactive activities on the upper floor. Some of the headier, more overtly educational exhibits did go over their heads and their engagement with them was very brief. After about 1-1/2 hours they were pretty well done exploring. 

Though I enjoyed my time at the museum, I found the layout rather counterintuitive; the bulk of the activity stations are, as I mentioned, on the upper floor/out of sight from the main entryway, and one's progression through the space is rather stilted.

While thinking back on the whirlwind four days I spent here, I can't help but smile every time I see my brand new tattoo. 

My origami panda stares back at me with perfectly straight lines and simply just exceeds every expectation that I could have had. My tattoo artist at Club Tattoo, Wakako was amazing. Don't let her petite statute and gentle voice fool you, she's got more skill with the needle than a samurai with a sword! Her artistic vision not only impressed me, but got my buddy to immediately request a tattoo from her after seeing mine done. You can't go wrong with this lady - take a look at her profile. Trust me. She's a pro! 

Perhaps what parallels my amazing tattoo was the overall shop experience. I was lucky enough to get to interact quite extensively with a good number of people, from Thora, who was willing to work with me and get a hard to find Pyrrha piece, to Joni, Lani, Robert, and let's not forget the two amazing ladies, Anita and Arkay. Every single person made my experience just that much better - and they successfully worked my wallet and bank account empty! 

The best part is that I'm leaving with great memories, and amazing tattoo, and one serious problem: I want to come back for more tattoos, and just to freaking chat with everyone!

I actually found out about this place via Groupon. They had an offer for $10 for $20 and I love seafood and I love chicken so I bought it figuring what did I have to lose!?

Well I must say I was not disappointed! When you walk in the doors you come right up to the menu and counter and the cooks are back there whipping up amazing fish, shrimp and chicken dishes right before your eyes....and that's enough to make your mouth water....because it looks so delicious!!!

So we decided to try a couple of there top favorites, the staff was very helpful with their top favs and helped make our decision much easier!

For starters we had the Bonehead's shrimp which are Crispy fried shrimp tossed with Boneheads sauce and served over cilantro slaw. The shrimp were cooked until golden brown and then tossed in to this delicious spicy and sweet sauce that was a perfect pair....they were soooo delicious! I almost wish we had a second order!

I chose the taco combo with the tilapia, shrimp and chicken....I figured I might as well try all three so I could compare and have plenty of variety! There is no issue with portion size here! All the tacos are filled with the meat and slaw and a side of your choice! The tilapia was cooked perfectly and full of flavor you could really taste the different spices they used to add extra flavor. The shrimp again were delicious, and covered in a seasoning blend and sauce mixture....the only thing I would add is some of the special signature Boneheads sauce...that would have made these tacos complete!!! Finally the chicken was really good too! Very tender and juicy! The tacos came with a side and I chose the fries, they were hot and prepared well just lacked seasoning and crunch in my opinion. Next time I would prefer a vegetable option. 

My boyfriend chose the salmon with the pineapple salsa topping which has 
pineapple, peppers and onions mixed with a sweet and spicy sauce. The salmon presentation was beautiful, I loved the grill marks and the taste was wonderful, it was flaky and tender and the sweet sauce added a nice combination of flavors for the fish. For the side, he selected the grilled zucchini which was sooo yummy!!!  Again, gotta love those grill marks! These are definitely a must try!

I will give the restaurant 3.5 stars and my food 2.5 stars. I was optimistic for my ramen dish, hoping to be reminded of the ramen, from many of the ramen shops in Japan. I was bummed with the serving size (for $11 with tax), but that is OK, I was most disappointed with was the taste. Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe something I did not agree with, it was oily and a bit too salty. The desert was a savior. Even though I can buy mochi balls for half the price and in more quantity elsewhere, I was glad they served it at their location. Convenience anyone? In addition, I like the black tea they serve, in a can. But the price was a little steep. If I'd go again, I'd just get water (I'll buy the tea on my own thanks).

Located in the upstairs of a building in the middle of Chinatown, without Yelp, I probably wouldn't have noticed it. There is a sign that is outside in front of the stairs that says ""Passport $6.99"", which helps if you weren't sure where to go. 

I didn't have to get my passport photo done, but I needed a passport sized photo. The man was very accommodating and had no problem with doing so. (I called a few places before hand and they were really touchy about this for some reasons...). He took two different shots and you will get to choose which one you wanted. Then, he does some minor editing, such as removing blemishes off your face - which is always nice. The man is really friendly and sociable. 

I got confused with the amount of photos I was suppose to receive, since i saw him print out 4, but only had 3 in my envelope. I found out when I got home and I gave them a call about it - they told me I can come in to pick up the forth one. In the end, it was my mistake - the $6.99 only includes 2 photos, so he has already given me an additional one. But, it was handled very professionally and he explained to me about the confusion. 

Definitely worth coming here for your passport (or passport sized photos in my case). Very fast service and you get your photos right away (unlike some places that require you to come back within 30+ mins.). Will recommend J.N Photo to all my friends and family.",10,Vc0SrTF60u0uAI1OgGSPsw

This was my first time attending after living in Charlotte my whole life.  I didn't have any expectations but the idea of getting to sample a ton of restaurants in the area sounded good to me!

The heat...didn't bother me....the people...didn't bother me...the quality of food...eh, didn't really bother me.
But, what DID bother me was the layout and the quality of vendors.  If you are claiming this is a TASTE of Charlotte then show me something worth tasting.  Hooters?  Salsaritas?  Costco?  Tons of bars and grills?  Come on.  I know there were a couple of good quality restaurants represented but to that point I agree with others that say the crowds are just out of control.  If you have to wait in a 2 hour line to get one of the 3 decent restaurants represented that it holds up the entire walkway..something is logistically wrong.  Maybe this should be held indoors at the convention center?  Maybe on a wider street?  I don't know but something wasn't working and you don't have to be an event planner to know that.

There was an element of class missing from the overall event in my opinion.  I felt like people would rather throw an elbow to get to the chicken wings than enjoy a stroll through yummy food lane.  

Overall...I thought it was brutal.  Would I go back?  Probably not unless I saw that they stepped up the vendor list and that the layout was totally different.

My two go to stores here are Nordstrom Rack & Trader Joes.  They also have one of my fav furniture stores, Ethan Allen.  I would be happy if they added more fast casual eateries like Panera, w/ a toddler fast casual is an absolute must.  We took our son for Easter Bunny pics yesterday morning around 10:30am and there was only one person ahead of us which couldn't be more perfect.

It's a small space, especially when it's too cold to go onto the patio.  Guests order at the counter when they enter and the food is brought to you - no wait staff.  What it lacks in comfort and ambience, it makes up in food.  The soups and wraps are AWESOME!  And the service is efficient and friendly.  Case in point, last week, my wife spilled her soup all of the table and they quickly wiped it up and brought her a new bowl.  Happy making. 

I've had the Apricot Soup, Portobello Mushroom Soup, Corn Chowder.  All thumbs up!!!  I've had the veggie wrap, pork shoulder and lamb wraps.  Veggie and lamb were excellent.  The pork was a tad dry, imo.  Personally, I always get the wrap and coup combo.  As others have noted, it's not cheap at $13, but it's really good food!  I also love that the food always arrives on these individual sized lazy susans.  Well, I did until my wife spilled her soup b/c of a outta control spinning susan.   

I'm salivating, just thinking about it.  Oh, this place FILLS UP at lunch, but it's pretty much empty at 11:55am, so I'd invest the extra 5-10 mins to show up just a touch before noon.",4,mv1IeIs9H8Or5GOi3JHxrw

On 9/18/2016, I visited the CVS Pharmacy located at 8116 S. Las Vegas Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada to use my 30% and 20% coupons.

Unfortunately the 30% and 20% coupons were not applied to the cologne I purchased. According to your Store Manager, Azucena (Suzy) the cologne was a buy one get one 50% off and the coupon doesn't apply to sale items. I advised the store manager, Azucena the product was not marked as a sale item and she rudely replied we're not expected to label every product that's on sale. Really, I'm a business owner myself and I expect my employees to do their job, it's disturbing a corporation as large as CVS wouldn't require the same from its staff, especially a member of their management team. Furthermore, if the proper sale signage was posted, they only had one in stock so they would be unable to honor the sale.

To add insult to injury when I requested the phone number from Azucena she threw the pin on the counter. Of course, I brought this to her attention and was abruptly dismissed. I have been a frequent customer at CVS Pharmacy's across the United States and have never been treated with such disrespect and disdain.

CVS Pharmacy should honor the coupons they send to their customers if the items are not marked properly by staff. Additionally, I suspect discrimination is a factor in this case.

The girl behind the counter looked like she loathed her job and was impatient with us since we weren't familiar with their ordering process. She robotically asked, ""how many doughnuts"" with a blank stare. We were new and we didn't have a set #, we were just shopping the display window and picking each variety as we go - are we terrible people?

We made rushed decisions and didn't feel welcomed to ask questions about the doughnuts. We ended up selecting 6 for $8. The doughnuts were good, but not life changing. I'm glad the doughnuts didn't taste like pure sugar but they could also use an extra edge or some sort of wow factor.

Doughnuts:
* Blueberry mousse - nothing too blueberry about the mousse, just the purple color and the blueberry garnish. The doughnut itself was very simple cake doughnut. 3/5

* Strawberry shortcake - very standard cake doughnut, using the same base like the above doughnut. Some white frosting drizzle and a little bit of tart and sweet chunky strawberry topping. The topping had small chunks of chopped strawberry and it really woke up the simple doughnut. Also finished with a dot of whipped cream on top. 4/5

* Cinnamon spice - standard cake doughnut simply coated in cinnamon sugar. It was a hair short of tasting like a churro. That's too bad. The dough was very doughy and dense. 2/5

* Buttermilk bar - tastes just like the classic - crispy glaze on the outside and doughy on the inside. 4/5 

* Classic glazed twist - tastes just like the classic, but oversized. You can't go wrong with this one. 4/5

They really didn't have a huge selection or variety tonight. I was looking for fun ones like the green tea or even the fat elvis one I saw on yelp. Nope, none of them showed up. They kept running out of flavors and taking doughnut cards down. Im not sure if that's a typical night for them or if I caught them on a bad night.

I've had stellar service for my oil changes in the past but my experience was atrocious and absolutely unprofessional at best.

First of all, they've changed the interior service area with these high counters which is a change from their desks they used to have. The usual crew that I normally see on weekdays were not there. 

I had to ask whom I can speak with when I got in. And there was one person behind this high desk on a busy Saturday. He was unapproachable and just rude.

The worst part is when I went to pick up my car. I go in confused as to whom I need to speak with for the payment. I find some girl behind a little desk with her half eaten sandwich in full view in front of her and myself and ask if that's where I pay. 

She casually said yes and rang me up to pay. No explanation of what they had done, no going through the multiple things they did to my car, and no updates on my car's condition. 

I had to ask the girl, ""Do you know when I need to change my battery or how my car is doing?"" Apparently the 30k mike service includes my battery condition. The girl just shrugged her shoulders and said she wouldn't know. I asked that I speak to someone about my car that can answer my question. If I'm spending 8 times the amount of money than I normally do, I'd like someone to give me an update, not be rushed to make a payment and leave. 

The girl pages the supervisor who comes around and tells me, ""Some cars need a new battery within a few months and some don't it all depends.""

WOW. I'd imagine they could tell me if it was at 50% capacity or 70% if they're checking my battery levels as part of the service check. 

The supervisor walks away. After I pay she asked, ""Did you see your car it front?"" I said, ""No."" Then she tells me, ""You can walk around to the side and keep walking to look for your car. If you don't see it, then let us know."" And hands me my keys. 

MY CAR WAS IN THE WAY BACK BEHIND THE BUILDING where there are NO customers at the back of the shop. And it was parallel parked in with 6 other cars in a line. I was struggling to get my car out of this tight area all the while thinking, ""Am I an employee or a customer?"" 

A guy in uniform saw me and helped me get my car out from this tight space. Imagine the liability if I had scratched up other customer's cars on my way out? What if that was YOUR car that I bumped into? Is there any quality assurance that we are leaving our cars in good hands? How many other customers have had to pull their own car out and perhaps left a mysterious dent or a scratch on my car that I would have NEVER thought came from the dealership?l

I couldn't believe that after spending 8 times the amount of an oil change, I'd have to walk to the back and get my own car from a tight space when they have brought it out front after a simple oil change. Just imagine me clicking my keys incessantly waiting to hear my car beep back as I walked the long stretch to the side and down to the VERY END and back like an imbecile in 110F Vegas heat. 

It's unfortunate that this is the only Subaru dealership in Vegas. I no longer want to get an oil change or any service, let alone a Subaru in the future. I felt demeaned and quite frankly writing this review brings back horrible feelings and gets me very upset. I'm going to have to find an external source for my future services. 

Oh yes, I forgot to add, there's a coffee cart with no one servicing the area on a BUSY Saturday, while I saw couple employees standing BEHIND the cart, enjoying their coffee chatting away.

For those of you rolling your eyes thinking I'm just a cheap drunk or that I never got far from my uni hangout... think again.  I spent most of my career in hospitality and Dee's wins first place in two categories that I judge a restaurant experience on.

Expectation - Does the restaurant exceed my expectations for value (food quality and quantity) and service?  Yes.  Dee's consistently delivers prompt, friendly service and reasonably priced food that is entirely prepared in their own kitchen.  They do not use frozen prepared food.  Even the guacamole is made fresh daily & they have lots of vegetarian options.

Ambience - Does the restaurant have a distinct feel?  Do they know who they are and what they are about?  Yes.  Dee's is a family-owned restaurant that hires hip servers (but only the ones who want to work for a living) and allows the staff to determine the look of the place.  It's clean, but a mish-mash of paint and old furniture.  Still one of the few places to see a real punk band (upstairs), too.

As a former concierge, I have had the privilege of dining in the city's top established restaurants. Dee's is the measuring stick against which I judge all dining experiences in Toronto.  Sounds silly - but when was the last time you got more than you expected?",5,mgfLGeUjMutfHmrHTr0ZLQ

Having never been to the restaurant before I found it to be in an odd location in the basement of the Pittsburgh Finance building.  We arrived at around 6 and were greeted by extreme quiet as we made our way to the hostess station.  Within a minute the hostess was there and greeted us asking if we had a Groupon or Living Social deal which we did not.  She then took us around to our seats where there was some more noise and people.  Since Storms is in the basement of the building, the lighting wasn't that great but the white table cloths and plants made it feel more inviting.  Don't expect to get any good cell phone service either which can be both a good and a bad thing depending on how you are looking at it.

For dinner I decided to have the Chicken Piccata with a side of pasta and a salad with balsamic vinaigrette while my fiance went with the Scoglio (Sauteed shrimp, sea scallops and chopped clams) and a cup of wedding soup.  The soup and salad came out quickly along with some bread and butter.  My salad was decent enough with the dressing being good but I really enjoyed the bread.  It was rustic, hearty and dense which was perfect for dipping into the leftover sauce from dinner.  As we were finishing our starters, the waitress came over to my fiance and informed her that she was just told by the cooks that they were out of scallops.  She was exasperated by the fact that they hadn't told her until after she had put in the order but reassured my fiance that she would get extra shrimp in her meal instead of the scallops.  After only a short wait our food was delivered.  My chicken piccata was solid with a nice semi tart lemon sauce with capers and mushrooms.  The pasta (penne) that I received was ok as well but it was nothing special. Even though I did not ask my fiance if she enjoyed her meal I could tell that she did as she ate all of the pasta sauce, even after the pasta was gone.  Since I finished before my fiance the server cleaned off my plate and then things at the table behind us got a little weird.  From what I gathered the lady had an expired groupon and ordered two meals expecting to be able to use the full value of the groupon.  Whenever she was not able to, she stood up and went to the front.  Our server went there to help her and then I am not really sure what happened.  The reason that I am mentioning this is that we proceeded to wait about 20 minutes before our server showed up again which was frustrating as we were long done with our meals by then.  She did apologize and while I do not put the whole blame on the server, I do think that she could have managed it and us in a more timely fashion and wish that she would have.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably stop back here again in the future.  While there was nothing spectacular about the food, it was solid Italian food and on its own would have garnered 3 stars.  The issue with waiting for quite a long time after we were finished bumped down the overall rating for me as it was an experience I hope to not have repeated again.",3,4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w

OyhCNhJJuJjUt2avxI5POg,1,2017-07-15,1,EDk56BmipeFuLQ4ud0q16g,2,"I was not impressed with the Chocolate Bar. One star for the name and another star for the decent Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini and Triple Fudge Cake I had. Other than that, this place is otherwise unremarkable.

When we first walked in, around 530 in the evening on a Wednesday during an Indians game, there were maybe three other tables occupied in the restaurant. We stood in front of the hostess station while a waitress rolling napkins attempted to avoid our gaze and four other waiters/waitresses walked by us. We stood there for literally...ten minutes until the waitress who was trying to avoid us by folding napkins was told to seat us. 

Perhaps it was our fault for not saying anything? 

No, their service is just really poor, and none of the employees there really care about customer service. 

While I was waiting for someone to notice my boyfriend and I, the ambiance of the restaurant is fairly nice. Dimly lit, a little classier feel to it but nothing remarkable. There is no parking, you have to park in a garage. The bathrooms are weird public bathrooms down the stairs and around the corner, also. 

It was happy hour, and their specials were not communicated anywhere online, nor shown anywhere on the menu... and our waitress did a poor job verbally explaining it. Their signature martinis are not part of happy hour, and ONLY SOME APPETIZERS ARE $4.95. The Chocolate Bar randomly picks week to week, or day to day, or maybe they choose it based on what you order. I'm not really sure.  

As for drinks, I love chocolate-based liquory nonsense drinks. I would really recommend a Chocolate Covered Pretzel Martini, it was really well made, delicious, chocolately, and I couldn't taste the liquor. However, for my second drink I ordered a Nutella Martini, which was legitimately poorly made. It was not simply poured heavily, it did not taste like Nutella and the vodka was extremely apparent. I was really surprised they did not use Frangelico hazelnut liquor, or anything remotely resembling Nutella. I was also surprised that each Martini did not list the types of liquors in each. I personally think that the Hofbrauhaus has much better speciality dessert martinis for $8 (rather than $10 at the chocolate bar)

I did not have dinner, but I ordered a chocolate cake, and I have no complaints with it. It was rich, fudgey, yummy, but nothing I couldn't have gotten somewhere else. I can't remember what it was called, unfortunately. 

I don't really see a reason to come back here, particularly because of the service.",0,nfGC_3F7-urw7FirVRMcdA

Especially coming from Los Angeles where I don't often experience rain, it was great to come here to listen, feel, and watch it rain!  The show starts out with fog and colored lights and is accompanied by lightning as the rain falls from the sky, I mean, ceiling!  It's fun to watch and is a free experience.

Show times are: Mon-Thur, top of each hour from 10:00AM to 11:00PM; Fri-Sun, every half hour from 10:00AM to 11:00PM

I think it is not possible to get drenched, but you will feel sprinkles if you stand close to the ropes.  Be careful walking by the area because the nearby flooring might be slippery.

I had no idea, but I read this, ""Before it became Planet Hollywood, this building was the Aladdin and the shopping mall was the Desert Passage"".  The rainstorm was a leftover feature from Aladdin.  I'm glad this is still an attraction!

Be sure to visit the Miracle Mile Shops and see this free falling rain show! 
 Even the parking here is free... so there's no reason to not come experience this for yourself (unless you're from a rainy climate and want to escape rain)!!",15,s_FAHFKUl4YqNofYZC1NYg

I'd say this brewery seems to be one of the popular ones in Charlotte especially on Saturdays. This place was definitely really packed when we went and it took awhile to get some beer but we got a flight so we only had to stand in line once. 

They do have an outdoor space and we eventually found a comfortable place to stand at. The flight that we got was pretty unique. It seemed that we got a lot of pour in a flight and you get to spin the flight holder which was cool. It was kinda pricey for the flight but it did seem that you get a lot of beer for it. 

My favorite beer from Wooden Robot is Good Morning Vietnam for sure. It's fresh and light.

French grocery also has a nice selection of imported cheeses and gelato. Their grand opening is July 9 after which they will also be having to go dinners and other items.

Check them out and try their beignets...and do make sure to ask for extra powdered sugar. It's just not the same without a grand amount of the powdered stuff...and dip the beignets in the coffee too!

we had several of the bar menu items which were just ok but not great (palenta, rice balls, porc belly and mahroom arugala salad). they lacked seasoning and were all just ok.
the pizza on the other end was great great great. perfectly cooked, crispy, think with great toppings.
we had 3 of them as well so lots of left overs for the next day (one was with carmelized onions, one with italian sausage and another with asparagus and mascapone)

we were very disappointed with the manager treatment which we felt not very classy for such location. we had purchased a voucher at the tix4less location (discounted shows and restaurants on the strip). the voucher was suppose to be for 20% off on all food items. unfortunately, when the bill arrived it turned out the bar menu are not a food item as they were not included in the discount. when we pointed it out to the waiter he said we should speak to the manager and he just brushed us off saying he will speak to tix4 less (surly its not the first time he heard of this issue as it clearly satted in the voucher all food items). this was clearly a misrepresentation by the restaurant as they are clearly being dishonest about it which is not at all something you can associate with wolfgangpuck!

all in all, the bar food was just ok but can easily skip this food item all together as it was not very tasty and apparently it is not a food item at all as per management.

the pizza's were all amazing in this location as well as others we had tried in previous times on the strip as well. pizza is the best bet

From the moment we checked in to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary to the moment we checked out this was really an incredible experience for my Petite, Red Headed Passion Flower and myself.  To a person the staff  was very gracious and engaging.  We are not 'Vegas People' and really felt comfortable here.  The check in and check out experience was painless.  The roses I pre-ordered arrived in our room within one hour of our arrival.  The view of the strip from our room was nothing short of stunning.  This was brought into full effect when we first opened our door to our room.  The curtains automatically opened and the lights came on to create a pretty impressive reveal.  Overall a truly remarkable experience my PRHPF will never forget!

For all this over-the-top indulgence we enjoyed to celebrate an important milestone in our lives came the understanding this was not gonna be cheap.  You need to be aware that all this came at a cost.  For example:  If you want a particular view, this is gonna be an extra fee.  And this fee will be taxed.  Daily.  Also there will be a daily Resort Fee.  And the daily Resort Fee will be taxed.  Daily.  Concierge service charges are taxed also.  The property will pretty much lighten your wallet wherever you go.  Understand this and you will enjoy your stay.  We did and have memories that will last for a long time.

In conclusion if you were to twist my arm and ask if anything could be done differently or better it was the experience with housekeeping the morning of our departure.  Sure.  Check out is 11:00 a.m.  We get that.  But housekeeping knocking our our door while we are still in bed to ensure we were checking out that morning?  Tacky.  I made sure I mentioned this to the very nice gentleman who settled our bill at the front desk.

Nice ambiance, while our waiters were knowledgable and efficient and friendly, not a fan of wait staff that aren't cross trained or authorized (?) to handle all requests. 

We tried a bunch of dishes - we started with the olives. Excellent. We then had a meat and cheese platter - the items with their accompaniments were all excellent. We especially liked the chorizo and the country pate.

I ordered the WTF pork chop with spaetzel - solid dish, though the pork chop could have been a bit more juicy. overall the dish was solid. I also tried my coworker's dishes - pumpkin gnochi was delicous as was the ricotta gnocchi with eggplant. My other coworker's ribeye deckle was also delicious, though still not entirely sure what part of the cow is the deckle. Nice to see some interesting cut.

We ordered a side of brussel sprouts which were delicious. Even the people at the table who didn't like brussel sprouts loved them.

During peak hours, parking can be a bit of a strain as Gigi's shares the lot with a few restaurants and some retail stores.  But generally it is a quick stop unless you are behind the family who has never had a cupcake before (""What is devil's food?  What is buttercream? Cream cheese like on a bagel for icing?""  Next time take them to HT for a 6-pack of generic cupcakes, PLEASE).

I enjoy cupcakes.  It's like a sickness.  But in no way I am a cupcake snob.  If the cupcake has some flavor of moist cake and an icing that isn't granular or hard, I will eat it.  Grocery store, bakery, Tastykake, whatevs... Some are better than others, but all are welcome, I am an equal opportunity cupcake inhaler.  

As the other reviewers have stated, the amount of icing is ridonkulous.  It towers above the cake and is just way too much.  The first flavor I tried was Wedding Cake (white cake, white icing) and it almost gave me the diabetes (I ate it on an empty stomach and was seeing spots in my peripheral vision when I was done).  Lesson learned that no matter how delicious it looks, do not eat all of the icing or you will need an insulin shot. The cake was moist and the icing was standard buttercream.  The wedding cake is a tie for my favorite with the Snickerdoodle (cinnamon swirl cake with cookie dough frosting, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and topped with a snickerdoodle cookie).  I learned my lesson with the first cupcake and took at least 1/2 of the icing off before eating the cupcake.  Again the cake was moist and the icing creamy.  The small cookie on top was good too.  The Lemon Dream Supreme was lemon cake with lemon filling and lemon buttercream - it was lemony and good.  I was not a fan of the Southern Comfort, the icing was as hard as a rock and sickeningly sweet, the cake was a very dense cake mixed with pecan pie - yuck.  It was like eating a brick, I tossed 1/2 of it away (that would be $2 that I threw away).   During the summer they had a margarita cupcake that was meh.  The Hunka Chunka Banana Love had too much going on - tossed that one out too.  I delivered a Red Velvet to a girlfriend and she said it was yummy.

Go during the day if you need a sugar fix, if you wait until after work to go, the flavors will be limited and a little dry.  

I continued to return to Gigi's to try new flavors, but never got the WOW that I thought I would from such lovely cupcakes.  They are just too much.  Too much icing, too sweet and instead of a happy tummy, I usually have a sugar rush and then a need to nap after the crash.  Lovely for an eye-popping gift perhaps, but for a cupcake fix, I will stick to the bakery aisle at Harris Teeter.",3,zsZBYWYEmLLs81_f-HHM8w

This is 100% not one of them.PAY a few dollars more to eat the best authentic Italian food in the state.As good as any in BROOKLYN OR MANHATTAN NEW YORK. Save time looking at my Italian reviews .

Through our legal journey, she has responded herself to our questions in a very timely  manner every step of the way. From the first, Zoe Terry listened, herself, to us and our problem. Every legal office we spoke to prior to finding Attny. Terry we had a brief hurried response from either the receptionist or assistant. The Attorney's office wanted a form filled out, brief specifics that couldn't even detail the information that we had to give. In a time of trauma or grief the last thing that people need is a feeling of being processed,  so they could be evaluated on paper as to whether the Attorney wanted the  case. That was just to get in the door, we couldn't even imagine having to work through legal issues in this manner.
   When we called Terry Law Group, we had an appointment set up to meet in the office with Attorney Terry in approximately one week.  The process was seamless from the beginning to the end. Although we had never ending questions and concerns she patiently explained every area, either through email or in person. Not one time were we turned down for an appointment or made to feel like an inconvenience. 
  I can say with certainty that Attny. Terry and her assistant was the reason our case was over in record time. My family and I recommend Terry Law Group highly and we were lucky to find her.  Thank you Attorney Zoe Terry.",0,NJgcs_f_jMU3eG5qvZki-Q

They have booths and tables with chairs for us big guys, plus the tables at the booths move so that's a plus.  I ordered the twice cooked chicken lunch special.  It came with egg fried rice, an egg roll, and soup.  I'm not a fan of egg fried rice so I tried to substitute it for pork fried rice but no luck.  They offered me the fried rice lunch special but I didn't want the fried rice to be the main entree.  They did, however, offer lo mein as a substitution for $1 more so that's the way I went.  I was surprised to have the choice of hot & sour soup instead of the customary egg drop soup, so I was pleased.  And now to the food; out first was the soup.  Not only was it hot temperature-wise, but also in spiciness.  This is by far the spiciest hot & sour soup I have ever eaten!  My nose was running when I was done with it, but it was a nice change to some of the bland h&s soups I've had in the past.  The twice cooked chicken was absolutely delectable and crunchy.  I guess that's a reason for eating there versus takeout.  I liken it to the house chicken you see in the majority of chinese food restaurants.  The egg roll was nice and crunchy, but not greasy.  The lo mein was good despite not having any meat in it.  Overall a very good meal with excellent service.  I would be a regular customer but I don't live or work near this restaurant but will stop by when in the area.

We arrived around 8pm after advising an hour late for our reservation and were disappinted that the reserved room was no longuer available for our group.

We appologised and offered to pay a fee, but The Lady  preferred to sit us at a corner booth instead . 

With attitude she then asked us if anyone else was coming and added a Chair at the End of the table for the one person missing . 

Whe then ordered drinks with the waitress whom by the look on her face felt more then akward of her bosses reaction . 

We all ordered a Speciality house cocktail as well as 2 bottles of red wine . The wine was great ( 36$) The Co ktails were ... water , No Taste , a waste ... 

We then ordered the main Course to Share @59.99$ for 2people Dégustation Menu . Which was very well explained by our waitress . 

The warm cloths used to clean our hands  were sented of lavender .  

The food I found to be very tasty quite spicy . I love the fact that we eat with our hands , all digging in the same big plate of food . 

I loved the appetiser !!! 

Being the fist time doing so I was affraid of getting food all over myself . 
The little ""Crepes"" used to grab the food makes it safe . lol ! 

We then got served an honey cider ,I did not like it
actually no one at our table did , again no taste.

We had for desert sample portions of cake @3.50$ each .  The best one was Pinneaple ! The others were ... bahh . 

At some point one of my guests asked for an appetiser to the ""Frustrated Boss Lady "" and she rudelly said "" the kitchen will be closing soon . "" and walked away without looking twice our way. 

No sorry ... No nothing ... 

Our bill came up to 160$ for two people Drinks included and tip. 

In resume , I had a good time with my friends and ate some Good Ethiopian food .  The drinks suck and wine is Ok . 

Maybe , If we arrived on time we would have actually gotten taken better care of who knows ....

I still dont think its good for business , I will not go back and my friends neither .

I was really emotional it really ruined my whole day . my husband really  took the time to plan everything out and surprised me and we couldn't even get a manager to help out the situation. we didn't even finish our food I was so upset. My husband had a special desert he bought for me from my favorite bakery that he wanted them to bring out and surprise me with but we just took it home and made dinner at home.

I will be informing the health department because These people have no saftey precautions when it comes to handling dangerous things and the phone has so many germs I also witnessed no gloves in kitchen and people wiping they're faces and not washing they're hands with no gloves. I definitely took pictures of everything and the most unacceptable hospitality and service very UNCARING people . It was also very cold in the restaurant and asked if the would shut the patio and they never tried to do anything this old man kept opening them and glaring at everyone , what an eye sore really made me uncomfortable.

I even called and asked for a manager after we left and the hostess asked why we needed to talk to him and she said it was not they're responsibility to deal with such matters , didn't even put the manager on the phone.

Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.

While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.

The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.

Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.

My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.

We began our night hoping for a reservation across the parking lot. When they were full we Yelped and found Marrakech right here so we gave it a shot. We were with a large group of 10 and were sat pretty quickly, about 15 minutes which was nice compared to the hour plus wait we left to come here. 

The music was very loud and we requested it to be at a more realistic level so we could talk during their 5-6 course meal. It would have been strange to sit there that long and not be able to talk at all. Every 45 minutes or so they had a belly dancing show with even louder music, which is fine since it's not too often and made for the experience overall.

It took a while (15 to get our initial drinks) where we ordered wines. Even longer yet to receive any food such as apatizers or bread. We acctually had to ask to receive something after another 20 minutes of receiving our drinks. 

The first place received was breads, humus, olives, etc. which was fine and the last quality food brought out. I won't go into the details of each dish to follow only to say for the expense we were not happy at all. 

The wait staff was pleasant but very slow and lacked understanding of the level of sound and need to communicate ones there.

The produce section is huge.  Excellent for leafy greens or garden produce.  When fruit is in season, their mix-n-match program is awesome because you can load 1 plastic bag up with seven different kinds of plums.  Makes shopping a lot easier.  They have hard to find stuff too like star fruit or dragon fruit, if you are into that kind of thing.

The meat department is one of the better ones in the area.  If they don't have it, you can order it.  I ordered 10 duck legs and 4lbs of duck fat which they got for me in a day during the holidays.  They have daily specials for the meat as well and you can really save some money by buying in larger quantities and freezing.

I would avoid the fish counter.  It never looks fresh (I am there probably 3X per week) and most times is still frozen.  There are better places in the area to buy fish.

The deli counter is awesome.  That's all I need to say about it.

Also, if you want inexpensive spices, check them out here.  You will save a couple bucks for each one and they are larger in size than at the standard grocery stores.

I went to Gene's shop with my car and he did incorrect work which did led unnecessary work, charged me more than the dealer would have, tried to milk 850 $ for a new computer (ECU), and pushed me into taking the car to the dealer to have it fixed. 

The dealer fixed it by fixing the wiring that Gene did wrong to begin with.


================= The whole story ======================

The story started when I got Crankshaft and Camshaft sensor error codes on my Nissan Altima 2005.

I bought the parts from Autozone and replaced them myself. It turned out that after spending 5 hours working on getting to a hard to reach sensor, it didn't fix the problem so I decided to take the car to Gene to have it fixed.

He proceeded re-wiring a connector that would no longer clip in after  I undid the crankshaft sensor.

That didn't fix it. He told me the sensors I got from Autozone were no good based on research he did online in auto forums and that I needed OEM sensors. I let him do the job. He replaced the sensors with the dealer sensors and the problem didn't go away.

Next he checked all the wiring for which he charged me 120$ diagnosis fee (dealer charges 90$). 

He told me it all checked out fine and that I needed to replace the computer (ECU) for something like 850 dollars.

So I took the car to the dealer to have the computer reprogrammed because usually computers don't just break to the point of no way to repair them. He did encourage me to have the dealer replace the computer so I give him that. 

Reprogramming the computer didn't fix the problem so I gave the dealer another 90 for diagnosis of the problem.

The dealer fixed the problem immediately after for 40 dollars! It was the wiring that was bad which Gene redid, and diagnosed for 200$.

Total rip-off Gene. Stay away. If you can't do the job yourself, take it to your dealer.

lesson learned for 370$ fee from Gene, 210$ from the dealer, 70$ in parts from Autozone, 5 hours of time wasted, frustration, and inconvenience of having to ask friends for rides for 5 days. 

Ultimately I took the car back to Gene after the dealer fixed it so that he can see what the dealer did. He refunded me 203$ which included diagnosis and CKP sensor replacement sensor. I'm still down 360$ though for the other stuff he did and the money I had to give to the dealer to diagnose, do what Gene did again and re-program the ECU which Gene said was bad.

He also said that I didn't deserve part of the refund because I was the one who broke the connector I had him fix in the first place.

The good part is that I got to hang out with my friend who helped me fix it for the 5 hours.",14,w51xb8Sajlz3f7hbc95HnA

WAARNING: my review may also be biased because -- well, you know, alcohol has that affect on ya and by the time I got HERE, i was well buzzed. So I'm going to comment on the decor. I also stayed  for.... an hour? Probably less.

I knew of this place with all sots of dangling things out side - I never went in for years simply because I didn't know what it was - it looks like pure dumpster and my thought was, if I am going to go to a dive, Sneaky Dee is just around the corner. I wish I had gone in earlier. 

Aside from the awkward stares we got when we walked in (3 Caucasian 1 Asian and a black man)  - and you can almost here their thoughts saying ""Fresh meat"" - I was blown away with nostalgia at first foot inside - all the lights and dangling thingamagigies all around creates this nice ,intimate atmosphere so you might actually be able to hear what your friend is saying right beside you. I found that to be really refreshing - because it's hard to find a quiet spot these days, because EVERYONE has live bands - and what was once a social night out-  became a deafening experience and you didn't really get to socialize. Don't get me wrong, I love live bands, but i think it takes something away too.

I even appreciated the fact that the dangling madness outside actually isolated the place completely and provided privacy- you really gotta look close even to see if it's open (actually we knew it was open cuz we heard low music).

From what I read here, it's a great place for a live music too - so I'll definitely have to check it on a weekend or something to experience it myself. For the moment, I am a fan -but I am a woman and inclined to change my mind every second - so I'll press ""post"" now, before I think too much and change my mind.",2,StCSYeJ1I-G1LbdpW65kGQ

This is it!!! I worked out 5 days a week before I got pregnant with my son 6 years ago. 6 years I failed, bounced around work out locations and gyms. Hired high priced personal trainers and nutritionists. None of it gave me the boost mentally I needed. I started strong, then quit. For 6 years I didn't have a good pattern until I found inferno last October. I can't tell you how much it's changed my life. You have to experience it. All I can say is that each instructor makes you feel more powerful than you were yesterday. With every class, you see a change whether mental or physical. As soon as you walk through the door, you are greeted with someone who makes you feel so welcomed. The facility is so clean you could eat off the floor. Everyone who works out there is your support system. No judgement only positivity. I'm not close to where I want to be as far as losing weight. But, I can tell you without a doubt, my mind is as strong as it's ever been. My body is changing for the better and I'm doing moves that I've never been able to do in my life (weighing more than I did my entire life). I'm 40 pounds down with another 40 to go. But, I don't look at the scale. I look at my strength, my mental state of mind and the fact that tomorrow I know I'll be stronger than I am today. If I miss a day, I feel like something is missing in my life. Gabby and her instructors are the best there is. When you walk out of their door, you feel on top of your life. Nothing can compare to that feeling. If you're ready for a life changing work out, this is your place!

Rachel's class will kick your booty into shape! She has the best energy and makes class so fun! We laugh and smile our way into working out! Love!",1,RbhKRxiG3oG09mB2Ftok6g

My daughter and I got gel filing with acrylic polish for our nails, which took an hour and 10 minutes to do (usually 45 minutes.) This in itself created a problem as we were coordinating the car with my grandson. We ended up waling home as a result because he couldn't wait any longer. 

During the appointment two of my cuticles were cut and bled. One became infected. I called to report this and was told the manager wasn't there and they would call me. I left my name and number.

I really enjoyed their Mushroom Swiss burger - it was a moist burger with great flavor from the Mushroom and cheese. My friends also opted to grab 3 different flatbreads. The flatbreads were kind of mediocre to good, but were also half off during happy hour. We agreed that the flatbreads were probably only worth it during happy hour. The veggie was pretty good, but largely due to the contrast in saltiness and sweet with balsamic vinegar. The buffalo had a TON of celery on it and was drenched in buffalo sauce, which just looked okay overall.

The place is small so it's not great for big groups (6 plus). Just a heads up.

The food there tastes like its prepped right when you order, which is a big deal to me at least! 



They have great meal combos (wrap + soup) that fill you up just right!  I ordered the chicken soup with the beef flank steak wrap, and I have to say it's probably my favourite combo there. 

The chicken hot broth contains a hint of spice but it balances well with the other savoury flavours. The flank steak has a nice balance of freshly cut steak, and sweet potatoes, and the other ingredients just compliment the two main ones. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fusion foods. (It's sort of a mix of wester/eastern from everywhere type of fusion). 

Only downfall is space and if you're not into spicy foods, your options are a little more limited. That is unless you ask for certain items to be spice-less, but then that defeats the purpose of the original taste.",0,a2cxPk9PJkSxV5fFTUL5TA

The lighter flavoring can also describe the lamb skewer, which are adorned with just a dusting of cumin seasoning - generally tasty and the meat is tender, though more time on the charcoal would have developed more flavor. The beef pancake was a little disappointing - not a whole lot of beef and pancake, though flaky on the outside, was a little gummy inside.

My bf and I were the only people in there on a Saturday night (first bad sign).  I ordered the Asian wrap and my bf got the highly promoted/advertised Jerk Chicken wrap and we shared a strawberry/kiwi smoothie.

The floor in the kitchen was a mess, I don't know why since there were NO customers in the whole restaurant.  The kid that took our order was super nice, repeated it back, rang us up, and then he made both our wraps while the only other worker made our smoothie.  Smoothie was great!  As I ate my wrap, it seemed to only have like 3 ingredients in it, chicken, lettuce, and carrots.  I checked their menu online for a description of what I ordered and sure enough they forgot the onion, cilantro, sesame seeds, and wontons! That's over half the ingredients he didn't put in it!  I checked my bf also and his was missing the asparagus but he didn't mind.  I went up to the counter and ask the girl what was supposed to be in mine and she had to go look on the computer for the ingredients!  LEARN YOUR MENU PEOPLE! what bad customer service.  She remade the wrap and it was actually pretty good but both of them were small in my opinion, they didn't fill either one of us up.

The store manager did come over and ask us what happened and I told her.  She then went on to tell me that the ingredients weren't prepped that's why they didn't make it into my wrap.  SERIOUSLY?! You're going to tell your customer that since you didn't have enough prep ready that you just aren't going to put them in the food?  She offered to take my info and keep it on file in the store for a free meal next time but I declined.  I wont be coming back here even for free...too many other good restaurants with great customer service that know their menu for me to waste my time going here again.",0,QrERrxbC6z6atN5Rz9CB2w

I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.

The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.

Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.

Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.

We were taken back and given a room.  Our nurse was AMY MASON.  She was AMAZING!!  I told her about my son's condition and how long it had been going on and she listened and knew just what to say.  She shared with me her family's struggle with her family member's illness.  She said afterwards, I don't know if what I just told you helps at all. 

I said to her that actually, YES, it really DID help a lot to hear her story and know that my family isn't the only one struggling for so long with a family member's illness.  She didn't have to share her story, but she did because she put herself in my shoes and felt that by possibly sharing her story, she could ease my pain.

So apparently you can't book for two people at the same time for a service that takes literally a minute and a half. First frustration, I try to do this and am told that instead I will have to book a second appointment. Ok, fine.  So I do. I arrive on appointment day and explain that if I can't get in at same time as my partner that I needed to cancel the 11:45a that you required me to book because I do not have the time. Instead of accomodating me for a minute and a half service (yes I mention again). We arrived early for check-in for the original appointment I had requested at 11:15a. We waited 11 minutes past the first appointment time. I find it unreasonable that they could not accommodate two people for the same service in 11 minutes. At 11:26a, they call my bf back. At 11:29a he's done and back out. We leave.


I get a call at 11:55 from Kimberley asking me if I was running late, I don't know if she gets confused easily or what, maybe she forgot the interaction 25 minutes earlier. I tell her that they couldn't fit me in and remember i cancelled the 11:45a appointment when I was in at 11:10a. She started on some crazy stuff about ""well our cancellation policy... blah blah"" I hung up, are you serious?

The best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth. If your lucky enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake. 

I haven't tried the Kobe steak yet, it is super expensive unless you are out for a special occasion. A lot of other reviewers seem to like the sushi.  I guess I'll have to miss out because I won't be coming back. I'll just keep going back to Benihana's! They never disappoint.",9,6urS-vMeMNMw1ogB577H7w

I am a frequent Buffalo Wild Wings Customer (more than once a week).  I typically visit the BWW in Henderson near the Galleria Mall.  The bar tenders (Megan, Jen, Steph and Tanya) are exceptional!

The bar service in this location is amongst the worst I have ever experienced.  The bar tender is typically too busy doing what appears to be nothing to be concerned with her customers.  I have recently had occasion to visit this location and both times have left feeling as though I was an inconvenience to the bartender. 

Unfortunately, I do not know her name as it is never on the check. 

The food is good and is consistent with all BWW locations.  Don't expect much in the lines of service if you sit at the bar.

Went here for dinner and split a pizza with my buddy.  They make it fresh - always fun to watch your pizza crust being tossed in the air :)  It does take a little bit of time to make it fresh so don't go here if you are in a hurry!  We got a 15 incher and it was pretty huge.  Naturally, I ate my half with no problem - decided to go with mushrooms and sausage.  I would call it a winning combo.  My buddy was not eating meat at the time so he went with tomatoes and green peppers.... not as fun as the meat and mushrooms, but luckily they are able to split the pizza with toppings so there's no arguing for 30min over what topping should be on the pizza.

The last few visits the pizza lacked the right amount of tomato sauce, which is one of the important ingredients for a good pizza.

The manager and all the employees have always been very  helpful and friendly to me.  Their prices are fair. There are a couple of store policy changes that I wish would change.  If they don't have the item in the store the only way they will order it in would be if you physically come into the store to have them order it.  They will not permit a request over the phone, it would make it easier for me if I could order the item over the  phone.  In addition when you request an item to be ordered in I would be nice to be able to pay for it at that time and be able to pick it up at your convenience.  Under the store's current policy you can't pay for the item until it arrives at the store, and once it comes in they will only hold it 14 days.  I have also done business with BUYBacks. BuyBacks policy also requires you to be in the store in order to order an item.  However they require you to pay for the item at the time of order.  You can have the item shipped either to the store or a place of your choosing.  If you have it shipped to the store they will hold it until you come to pick it up since you have already paid for it.  I like both stores, however over the past year I am tending to favor The Exchange.

qvBkj8tcLwv2QMF9jhH12A,1,2016-06-22,0,OT-kTqvRZSdJvRjkC41Z8Q,1,"This place usually isn't one of my go to sandwich spots, but I was craving one of their smoothies so I decided I would give it another try since their food isn't too bad either. 

I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them. 

I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink piña colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea. 

The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before. 

I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone ""YES!"" And the guy looked back at me and said, "" She said she put it on there."" I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this. 

Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else. 

I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far. 

One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service.",5,cAiTeHplBiqPM6ihR4_5Bw

I wish our experience had rivaled others but it definitely did not.  We arrived at lunch time on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there. We were seated right away by the owner (?) and looked over the menu.  We ordered a fried chicken lunch, hush puppies and a BLT with a salad.  I didn't expect it to be speedy--good Southern food shouldn't be!--but it took 45 minutes for the chicken to arrive and my sandwich never came. The waitress said it had been overlooked (again, we're the only customers there) and would be made right away. Someone else (a manager maybe?) came over to apologize and assured me our meal would be discounted.  She specifically said to the waitress ""let me know when their bill is open; I need to put in the discount."" The owner then came over and made his appropriate apologies for the error and offered a side/dessert.  He was very friendly and accomodating.  When the bill arrived, everything appeared to be full price with no discount but I had only a moment to look over it because the waitress was literally hovering over me with her hand out trying to take my credit card.  When I got it back (I know, I should have clarified everything first) I asked her to point out the discount, as ""everything here appears to be at full menu prices"". Her only response was ""it's on there. She had to ring it in separate"" after which she just quickly walked away without another word. No explanation, no answer, no resolution.  At that point we were so irritated we just left although I'm confident that had I showed the bill to the owner or the manager they would have made good on their word.

I always worked with George the Manager who is now no longer there unfortunately. George was always great, helpful, friendly and seemed to be very honest in what repairs needed to be done.

I took my car there last week for an oil and filter change. I dropped off my car with Mike who was not friendly at all, seemed pre-occupied with whatever other work he was doing and I felt like he truly wasn't listening to me when I talked to him about what I needed done.

When I picked up my car, I spoke to Scott who was at least a bit nicer and he went through and explained what their suggestions were for future car repairs and the pricing but I still didn't get a great feeling from him that I would be taken care. I had my breaks done there sometime back so it will be time to get them replaced soon and since they are on a lifetime warranty, all I would need to pay for is the labor which he said would be $60. Since he quoted me a price last week, I naturally thought that information would be saved in the computer system for when I was ready to get it worked on. 

Today, I called to confirm the price and make an appointment to take my car in. Mike answered and at first quoted me $139.99. I then said that Scott had quoted me a different amount. Mike then quoted me $70.00. I again said that that was not the amount Scott had quoted me. At that time, he asked what Scott had quoted me and I told him $60.00. He said if Scott quoted me that then they'd honor it. What I don't understand is, why wasn't Scott's original quote already in the system in my file? Why am I being given another 2 higher quotes? If I'm a ""valued customer"" why am I not given the correct and lower quote right away? And furthermore, how am I supposed to trust what they are telling me is correct on what needs to be done?

bxBMyrgSjsyDa5IdV-9rEw,0,2018-08-20 21:04:28,0,NvLVRwTKDNBqOgllYRVn9Q,2,"I lived here for three years starting in 2015. First two years were good and I had nothing to complain about. I never had bug issues, maintenance requests were completed quickly, front desk did what they were supposed to, landscaping was clean. The only complaint I really had was that the front gate code is a joke and the gates were either left open or didn't work a good chunk of the time. That's why I gave them 2 stars which Yelp says is ""Meh, I've experienced better."" This past year however has been another story completely. They changed management companies (again) and things just haven't been good. They don't seem to be screening people that apply for apartments because a lot of the new tenants are honestly pretty sketchy or disrespectful and cause trouble. I and other tenants put complaint after complaint in about a neighbor who did not understand the concept of a shared living area and nothing ever got done about them. The only response I got was ""it's so hard to evict someone...I'm so sorry."" Another thing is that they insist on using paper and mail to send out very important information. We live in a time where everything exists online and there are automated emails and phone calls that can be sent out in addition to paper. They even use an online portal for bill payments and they have all of our contact information on file. However, they insist on paper and paper gets lost or blown away by monsoons. These apartments used to be pretty good value for money and it was safe and clean. I loved Cindy at the front desk. She was always so helpful. However, they really need to get their act together and figure out how to screen new tenants, make the community functional and safe, and move towards using email/web portals/phones as a means of communication. These are my suggestions to the complex. 1) Replace the gates at the main entrance and extra exit so that they are reliable and please use a gate code that is not easy to guess. Also, put some sort of signage at the sidewalk end of the extra exit to remind people that it's not an entrance because once again that gate is broken and left open so often that people just zoom into it from the street and almost hit other cars driving near that exit. 2) Keep up with landscaping throughout the entire complex and not just the entrance. The entrance looks pretty and well kept but the rest of the landscaping is dusty and depressing. 3) Instal really good lighting in the parking areas and between buildings. For those of us who work nights or get home really late, it can be really disconcerting to walk back home when you can't look clearly at your surroundings. The lollipop lights do not put out nearly enough light. 4) Please screen your tenants. It becomes a worse issue for management in the future if you just start accepting everyone. If they look like they might cause trouble, you can deny their application. That's why the concept of the apartment hunt exists because people know that their applications to apply to apartments can be rejected. It's a BS response to be told that there's no way to screen possible tenants. 
TLDR: I would skip this apartment complex if you live on your own, work late hours, or if you have a young family. It's not worth the stress. Look further north and west in Glendale.",2,tqEIP04Rt9vFDuDnrSwTrg

I brought in my car because I had an issue with vibration at freeway speed. I thought my tires were out of balance, but a tire shop informed me that I had two bent rims. I knew Snail repaired bent/scratched rims, so I brought in my car and figured I'd get the wheels powder coated in the process. 

$400 later, my wheels looked fantastic. Every bit as good as new. They informed me that the bends were so slight that they required minimal work to straighten and thus didn't charge me. Awesome! I was a happy customer. Until I drove my car. 

Yep, vibration still there at freeway speed. Maybe slightly better, but nowhere near being gone. I brought my car back to them. I informed them that the vibration was still there, and to be fair, they didn't charge me to straighten the rims. I was willing to pay the price to straighten the wheels, since that's why I came in originally and they didn't charge me for that. They said they'd check it out, so I left the car there and went out of town. 

No communication. I called when I got back in town and was informed my car was done. Cool. When I went to pick it up, I was informed that three of my rims were bent and needed to be straightened. They said my tires had a weird wear pattern and that it might still cause vibration until I replace them. $480. What??!? 

They charged me to RE-powdercoat the wheels they just powdercoated for me. I would not have had to do that if they would have straightened them correctly the first time. 

When asked about it, the woman behind the counter pointed to the invoice and said ""you signed it and agreed to the price."" Uh oh...my fault for not reading what I signed. I usually do. I own that. Still...the work that needed to be done was NOT explained to me prior. I was just handed the thing to sign with zero explanation that my wheels would need to be refinished and they would charge me for it a second time. If this would have been explained to me beforehand, I would not have agreed to the work being done. 

So I've paid $880 to have wheels straightened and powdercoated twice. I could have bought a decent set of new rims for that. I'm NOT happy and will never go here again. And yes, the vibration is still there. I won't blame Snail for that until I try new tires. If that doesn't solve it, I'll update this review accordingly.",2,DOF7BAKEzvZT4Z78MRorjA

Until I show you my Yelp check in deal and for some reason, my check is never correct. My last two visits have been this way. The first time was an undoubtedly a mistake, but the 2nd time-not so much. I'm sorry. I know I'm not your typical uppity Scottsdale clientele-but I'm a Yelp check in addict. And if they're going to give me a deal on drinks, I'm going to use it. I get the look of annoyance upon correcting you. The last time I was there, I tried to use my check in deal. I opened a tab with a credit card, and when I went to go close it-the bartender just swiped my card without letting me know how much my tab was and also, didn't acknowledge me trying to get his attention when I tried to let him know I had a check in deal. When he gave me the tab, I let him know about it and he acted like there was nothing he could do about it because he already ran the card. Until I said I was trying to get his attention and he ignored me-then magically he could void that charge. 

On a more positive note, I do like Mabel's. The atmosphere is great, it's definitely classy and upscale. The customer service is very inconsistent.

Called around and got estimates that started at $400, because any work done between Friday evening and Monday morning is considered an ""emergency"" and there's an extra fee for that. 

On Sunday evening I decided I'd call around to get something set up for Monday morning. Came across The Garage Door Kings on Yelp!. Contacted them via the form on their web site, expecting to get a call back on Monday morning.

I got a call 15 minutes later. I was told that William (the owner) could stop by. I expected that the woman on the phone meant that he could stop by on Monday morning. Nope. He could come by in about 20 minutes, and take a look and give me a free estimate. 

That sounded great. So William came by, took a look, explained everything that needed fixing, and gave me a quote. The quote was fair, and I said let's do it. I imagined that he'd start work on Monday morning.

Nope. He started working on it right then and there. 

30 minutes later, garage door was working again, and better than it was before the spring broke. 

Can't possibly explain how good it felt to have somebody come out on a Sunday night without charging an ""emergency fee"". And then to take the time to explain what needed to be fixed, and what he recommended I have addressed (totally optional, but I did go with one of the recommendations). And then, of course, to have everything fixed on a Sunday night.

As we passed through the dining room to the bar, we noticed many vacant tables.  If it's the restaurant's policy not to seat till the exact time, fine, but there's a better way to say it.  Try something like:  Your table's not ready yet, would you like to wait at the bar?  Then the bartender decided I was taking too long to decide from the cocktail menu and said he would go make the other three orders and come back for mine.  When he returned, I ordered the same cocktail my husband had.  In a vaguely contemptuous tone, the bartender urged me to try it first, ""to make sure.""  I did and said that's what I wanted.  He then informed me, very inappropriately, that he could have made two at once but now had to go make another one.  I pointed out that he walked away before I could order.

I had originally purchased the Groupon, however they said that Saturday was the only night they didn't accept Groupons so I ended up just paying for the full service. First of all, I LOVED the decor and concept of the salon! It's decorated beautifully and it feels open, clean and luxurious. There's a bar in the entrance, and sinks and pedicure, manicure and blow dry stations on the other side. 

The person who did my hair was super friendly and I really enjoyed chatting with her. I wish she had asked what I wanted before I started though, because I prefer big curls in my hair. She put manual rollers into my hair to curl it that way, and it ended up coming out a bit flat. Perhaps I should've been a little more assertive in the beginning, however she kept saying ""it looks so good"" and I felt bad saying anything otherwise. My hair did smell amazing afterwards though, and the hairstyle I guess was ok.

I don't necessarily think it's worth the $60 to come here for a blow out, when I feel like I could've done a better job at home. The Groupon is worth it though, since it's half price and you get a free glass of wine!

I've been a big fan of Bahama Buck's for years, so when this location opened in Gilbert, my wife and I were pretty excited. It's got everything you want from a BB location: A fun lively interior, loads of delicious flavors, and a drive thru. 

My favorite flavor combinations are blue coconut/pina colada, root beer/birthday cake, or Coca-Cola with just about anything. 

Make sure you get a punch card, because once you start going it's easy to rack up the punches quickly. Certain occasions will even warrant double punches, like particularly cold days or certain months of the year (right now is a July double punch promo for BRMs). 

BB is great for a refreshment on a hot day. A place to meet friends. Bring your kids because there's something for any age (literally, they have a kids plain shaved ice).

Other reviews complain about Sea being expensive. As I mentioned above, some portions may seem small for the price but I wouldn't call it expensive.

I rarely give out 5 star ratings but this place deserves every star. Came here on a Wednesday evening with a party of 6, and reservations were not difficult to make.

Food: I sampled both the mushroom salad and tuna appetizer to start. Mushroom salad was very flavorful and fresh, but the tuna was what blew me away in terms of freshness and texture - you can absolutely taste the quality. My colleagues were also highly pleased with the harvest salad which came together nicely with the whipped blue cheese. For my main, I ordered the chicken adobo, not expecting much, but it was tender, and the skin was crispy. Every part of the dish was such an amazing blend of flavours; I didn't know that chicken could be done so well. My colleagues enjoyed the pork dish as well, though I thought I could have been served warmer, but a minor nitpick in the larger scheme of things. And dessert didn't disappoint either. We had the Phillipino citrus dessert and the gingerbread and pear with ginger ice cream: the desserts were very different in character but I enjoyed both. The gingerbread was not overwhelmingly gingery but retained just enough flavour, and the citrus dessert was a unique tart flavor with a marshmallow compliment to juxtapose the texture and sweet with tart. All round consistent and excellent food.

Service: Our server was the right amount of attentive and knowledgeable. water and wine were refilled at a good cadence, and service was prompt and friendly. Definitely enhanced the experience.

Ambiance: The decor is kind of kitschy and the ambiance was more on the intimate and romantic side. It is definitely a date-eligible location and was relatively quiet on a Wednesday night.

Not the very very best poutine I've ever had but a serious contender. Mine was around $8 for my regular sized poutine and a pop and my coworkers was about a buck more including a pop. Lots of gooey cheese curds (which is part of what I like, none of this grated cheese crap), lots of that yummy touch-of-rosemary gravy and yummy golden fries. Note to self: mix well before eating next time. Oh, and the pulled pork was AMAZING, I was really surprised!

I don't think you can go wrong with anything here (except for the likely overpriced fancy sodas they offer). If you're in the mood for something indulgent like a poutine, Smokes is one of the best places for it.",1,vJGLEHyhCs9V-5fAe-xx3w

Then came back and said would you like to order your food.  We asked could we get a menu of both food and beers?  He brought menus over and the first couple of beers we ordered he said oh we no longer have that.  Finally we got beers they had.

In a side note vodka was getting infused with pineapple in a container by us.  There was a lady who seemed to be training the bartenders.  We asked her about the pineapple and vodka and she said that it had not set nearly long enough but they prided themselves on creating their own mixes that were fresh.

Food wise the chicken parm was good.  The linguine in clam sauce was just all oil and tasteless.  Tonight we had a pizza.  We ordered the sausage with peppers.  it took 55 minutes to get and then came out with sausage peppers and onions.  While we sat at the bar a couple came in and said they were waiting for a table.  Then we watched with them as other couples came in and got tables.  They left in disgust. 

People behind the bar seemed to have no clue.  When our pizza came out we had to ask for plates and silverware.  The bartender said no problem then proceeded to take payments on food so we had to wait even longer.

The moment you combine sushi and thai in one place, you know neither will be the best ever. The place is small and unassuming, rarely full (I was there on a Saturday night and barely half the place was full - and got even emptier around like 9PM) and does not try to over impress with anything.
From my perspective, the place is nicely decorated, clean and has a nice vibe to it. Tables are pretty close together but the emptiness allows you a lot of privacy. Not a bad place for a date :)
Service is a bit slower than expected as only one waitress works there. Not the best thing, but when the place is so empty you really don't need more. We got served and used the waiting time as a nice moment to chit chat with my girlfriend. 
The sushi mix plate was quite nice - not mind blowing, but did the trick (I will admit I am not a sushi fan). I had the yellow thai curry and my gf had the vegetarian pad thai. Both really good (my yellow thai curry with the coconut rice was a great experience and enjoyed every bite of it). Did any of them beat the quality of a top sushi or thai restaurant?

Also many of the tricks are better viewed up close, I think, since they don't really have a video monitor for the whole show. So if you have the money, I'd recommend sitting closer (though you're at a greater risk of getting called on stage)! If you got discounted tickets like me, rest assured that sitting in the back or side is just fine. When we picked our seats at the box office, the diagram showed us at the very side, but when we got to the theater it didn't feel far out at all. I think any seat has a decent viewing angle.

It starts off with a envelope signing and box viewing experience, where you get to sign an envelope and view a box for two tricks during the show. The box trick was pretty good, though the envelope one was so-so. The rest of the tricks are done well, though they felt very short and discrete. It's a mixture of Penn and Teller doing something big, followed by Teller doing something simple. All in all a fun show to watch.

Transportation to the Rio isn't super convenient, since it's off the strip. You can get free shuttles from Bally's and/or Harrah's, but don't expect them to actually come every 30 min.

I enjoyed the atmosphere of the venue and I thought it felt kinda upscale in a mysterious way... There is a weird mannequin decoration right when you walk in and I appreciated that.

I wasn't that hungry when we went so I ordered only the Onion Strings. 
I had never had more delicious Onion anything!! They were cut, breaded and seasoned perfectly, I couldn't stop eating them. 

Boyfriend had the BLT and the bacon on it was phenomenal. If all bacon tasted like that, I sure would be one big girl. I never jumped on the Bacon bandwagon but if it tasted like that I sure would!

I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.

Currently the restaurant is still in their soft opening. They are open 5p-12a Monday through Saturday, have a full bar, and a ""limited menu"". To be honest the menu a it stands now was sufficient choice and variety for me and I was happy with all the options. They have a variety of ramen bowls you can customize with add ons to elevate the bowl to an even higher level of flavor. One of which is the butter bomb which I did not get to try but definitely have my eye on for my next visit. 

This was my first time here and I got the Shio ramen. It came with crispy pig ears, pork belly, scallions, sesame seeds, and a soft boiled egg. The noodles were a little under cooked for my liking in a ramen bowl but the flavor was amazing. I appreciate that they make their own hand pulled noodles and you can tell by the freshness and flavor. I also tried the Inferno ramen. I was a little less impressed with the flavor but a beef bowl isn't usually my go to anyways so I expected this. I also tried the Ti-Ki punch that had vodka, hibiscus, and elderflower and am still drooling over this refreshing and light drink. The size of the draft beer was a little smaller than what I was expecting but also very delicious. 

Overall I think it's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. I'll be recommending this place to all my friends who still live here and definitely be back to try the shoyu ramen as soon as I'm back in town!",1,Ogv-B7xOwbRkQrdoHvhn7A

First and foremost, this place is considerably more upscale than most of the other hotel/casinos owned by Station Casinos. The place is beautifully decorated, and has numerous restaurants and quicker dining options. There is even a movie theater and arcade so that the kids won't be bored should you go off to gamble. Despite its upscale appearance, this isn't some pretentious place where you are looked down upon if you aren't dressed like a movie star. 

The hotel room we were given for the stay was amazing, given that this was merely something we won for a night (I can't say for sure if they have other levels of rooms, though.) It featured an HDTV mounted to the wall, a smaller TV mounted to the bathroom wall so you could watch TV while in the tub, and a gorgeous view of the pool area. However, when we first came up to the room there were too people leaving it just before we walked in, claiming they had been ""reassigned"" - not sure what that was all about. Also, there were undrained sinks and an unflushed toilet when I entered - but these were seriously the only major problems with the room.

The concert venue, the Rocks Lounge, was something of a disappointment in that was standing room only. I have seen shows in other Station Casinos club-type venues (Boulder's Railhead, Fiesta Rancho's Club Tequila, etc.) and they always set up chairs in those venues. Would it have killed them to do that here? 

As far as parking goes, you need not fear - the resort has TONS of it. There are two entire garages, a west and east one. If you're just coming for the movie theater or dining, you can park in the west one, which is convenient for that side. If you're staying in the hotel, the east garage is right there. 

Quite honestly, I didn't know what to expect from the staff here - I have had some bad service at times in other Station Casino properties - but that was no issue here. Everyone was very professional and courteous, and did a damn good job.

Ultimately this place got the job done and then some. If you're asking me if you should stay here during your trip to Vegas, I strongly recommend it - only major complaint in that department is that it isn't near the Strip if you want to go sightseeing there - so something to keep in mind.",2,qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ

We arrived 30 mins early (as the website indicates to place our food order). We had to wait 15 minutes in the lobby before they'd allow us to take our seats. There were two perks, the staff was friendly and the menu had a broad selection of foods and drinks. 

We placed our order immediately. It arrives nearly 30 minutes later during the movie. We didn't order any extravagant so I'm not sure why it took so long to come out. We ate our food and tried to enjoy our movie. However the constant foot traffic from the servers during the movie made it frustrating and hard to enjoy. The seats were decent, but did not recline as most theatres in this ""eat and watch"" business like AMC. 

Shortly before the movie ended we received our bill. There were items on there that we did not order. I tried to bring it to their attention after the show as to not be rude and speak during the movie. ""Sorry ma'am, we can't help you now that the movies over. You should have asked your server during the movie."" Seriously? The same people who preach silence during the movie want me to take up a conversation during the movie to correct our bill? I was heated but paid the bill and vowed to not return. Later this evening the three of us that went realized that we are all suffering from food poisoning. How does one get that from a pretzel, motzarella sticks, a kids quesadilla and a hamburger? 

Bottom line: it's a different experience from your regular Harkins, but I'd visit Harkins any day over going back to this place. If you've had the luxury of ""dine and watch"" at an AMC theatre, you'll definitely hate this place. Food was WAY overpriced ($65 for 3 kids menu items, a soda, kids milkshake, a hamburger and 2 cookies that were $6 a piece and the size of a silver dollar), wasn't even decent, couldn't get the bill straightened out (didn't even receive a sincere apology from anyone, just an excuse), foot traffic from the servers made it hard to focus, and to find out hours later my daughter, mother and myself are all suffering from food poisoning. DO NOT waste your money. Honestly, it's not even worth purchasing the Groupon they have available right now for discounted tickets. You'll find me at a Harkins or AMC any time I want to watch a movie in the future.",1,Mv-ZZ5CMfOtp_-HqEUixIg

Their meat is definitely high quality, but not THE best...could be in Toronto for the price. I think we prefer their regular dishes.
We later return to try their Bento box. This would be the reverse of our sentiment over the stone grill thing. It appears to be gimmicky, but it is definitely not that. Each box is custom to what is fresh and best to serve. You get to experience different spoonful of a festival of taste. While it is not cheap, you get every nickel you spend worth it (can't say ""penny"" anymore....not as catchy).

#1) The health score / restaurant grade system must be extremely generous, because I can't imagine most of the 'A' rated places in Vegas passing with anything higher than a 'B' in LA -- and probably more likely, a 'C' grade. Unfortunately, I don't think Ronald's is exempt from this predicament.

#2) Las Vegans are afraid of real Vegans. I base this not only on the fact that there's NOTHING for us to eat in the whole city (save Ronald's Donuts and Rainbow's End), but also on the fact that Ronald's doesn't advertise the fact that most of their donuts are in fact vegan. I think they're genuinely afraid if they advertised their donuts as ""vegan,"" they'd lose business because people on the SAD would be too doggone afraid to try them! So they don't tell anyone that their donuts are vegan unless you ask directly. And when you DO ask directly, the sweet lady behind the counter (bless her heart) actually seems to look both ways to make sure that other customers won't overhear her. Sad but true... If only people would smarten up and check their insecurities at the door.

Loved the ability to hang out in the hammock chairs and tan outside. The premises are clean, smell nice, the locker rooms are great. The service is fantastic.

The restaurant however was a little disappointing. The food was nothing special. The presentation of the food was beautiful but the flavors and taste were lacking. I had the fish filet and it was just okay. My friend had the arancini and loved it (I tried some and it was indeed delicious). The tuna tartare was extremely disappointing. It was cut into chunks that were too big and didn't taste very fresh, nor did it seem marinated/seasoned very well. Tartare is technically raw flesh but shouldn't taste or feel like you are eating dry unseasoned raw flesh imo. Also, they charge you the tip (""service fee"") in advance, which wasn't appreciated considering the restaurant service was most definitely not up to par with the service in the rest of the spa. We almost sensed some attitude from our server.

The massages my friend and I had (therapeutic massages) were great, the therapists were professional and listened to our needs. However the massages were not exceptional like they have been at other spas. 

Overall I would recommend to go for maybe an esthetic treatment or one of their more novel massages if you're looking for something different (like their bamboo massage for example), and to go enjoy the water circuit which seemed nice (we didn't try them) or maybe a cappuccino and some desert at the restaurant.

I'd been wanting to see this show regardless, but free tickets can't be really be beaten!

The show is set in a smallish (for this part of Vegas) theater, where you sit at tables with 7 others.  You can buy drinks (for a hefty price), but you're probably better off bringing in your own.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, and the crowd around me was fun and lively, with most people on their feet for much of the night, and everybody in really good spirits.

Anyway, as for the show... The four guys are great singers, cute, and put on a very entertaining performance.  They sang and danced (with fun retro dance moves that reminded me of seeing Jersey Boys) for about two hours.  They sang hits from a variety of bands and singers that really encompassed the whole Motown era nicely.

I was already a fan of Motown music, so didn't need much convincing to enjoy myself, but these guys did a nice job with each of the songs they picked.  Their band includes some very talented musicians as well, though I have to admit that my favorite parts of the show were the a capella versions of songs that REALLY showed off the guys' vocal ranges!  My absolute favorite was their version of Smokey Robinson's ""Ooo Baby Baby"".  Simply beautiful.",1,krPv1EIMc2CZS95wEU7-aw

My love made a reservation here before our Smiths Center engagement...convenient location, with 4 1/2 stars on Yelp Reviews...sign me up please!

I was greeted with a red rose and accompanied by three handsome gentleman...how can a girl not be over the moon already?  Two of our friends had arrived just ahead of us and were already sipping on old fashioneds...I am not an expert on cocktails by any means but these old fashioneds were not the best I have tried.  

All the staff at Hugo's Cellar, from waiter to the sommelier, John, were friendly and professional with a welcoming manner. John was wearing a small metal bowl to taste all the wine he opens for the night...what a lucky guy with such a pleasant manner. We were already in an incredible mood when Gene, the Salad-mixologist, topped it up with this engaging preparations...he's been working at Hugo's Cellar over 3 decades...patiently and kindly aqurairing our preferences for the table-side salad making. He offered three different house made salad dressings, as wells as anchovies, hardboiled egg, lettus, shrimp, onion, mushroom, tomato, croutons, blue cheese, parmesan cheese, hearts of palms, pine nuts...Gene literally brings out a cart full of ingredients and asks for your likes and dislikes. Then, he prepares and mixes it right in front of you...very freshly special.  

Before our entree, we received a Raspberry Sorbet cone to cleanse our palettes. For the entrees, my love and I shared the Trio of Seafood, and a Filet mignon.  The seafood came with sweet potato, white and green asparagus, stuffed tomato, Crab cake, Shrimp, and Sea bass...the taste was all alright, but the presentation was lacking in some parts. Our Filet was cooked perfect for our request, and came with mashed potato, asparagus and a duo of mushrooms...it all tasted average. We also received a complementary dessert tray with chocolate covered strawberries, dark chocolate covered apricots, and figs with white chocolate...there were all good but not so stimulating as to promise our return visit...but we loved Hugo Cellar's wine selections and services from the beginning to end... 

I am grateful to Hugo's Cellar for keeping the old Vegas setting...adoring the ladies with a red rose, and the authentic service...but not so much for the food and presentation.

This was the MC Winter Wonderland Package, which included 2 complimentary buffets, free play money, and coupons to restaurants in the hotel!  Too bad, we never tried out MC's buffet for free!  I We got the 31st floor room which was an awesome view of the mountains and sun rising and freeway full of cars!  I wanted the strip view but the bellman was right.. The new city buildings under construction are hiding Monte Carlo's view of the strip so it was better that we got the other view of Vegas!  The 32nd floor was closed for renovations.. I think the whole hotel is under renovations in general.. the lobby of each floor is pretty empty with like 2 chairs and carpet.. nothing too special or fancy.. But hotels are hotels right... I was barely in my room the whole entire trip anyways! Beds, pillows, and blankets were definitely comfortable for my taste after a long day and night of walking/gambling around.  Valet is complimentary for guests. There is a parking lot across the street for short term parking which is hard to find though.. It is packed! The outside of the hotel has a nice theme/decor to it which i absolutely love.. but the inside just really doesn't match it at all.. I guess they got lazy!

Casino: Nothing too fancy..no decor really.. just some casual place to gamble downstairs if your feet can't make it anywhere else!

The restaurant is no frills and isn't very big- there's a dining area in the front and another in the back. Nonetheless, it's usually busy and for good reason. 

The food itself tastes great and is cooked well. I really like the imitation duck and vegetables. It makes you feel like you're having a cheat meal but you're not. Most of the dishes have a great amount and variety of vegetables- something sometimes hard to come by in vegetarian/vegan restaurants without paying ridiculous prices. 

Speaking of which...we ordered 3 items thinking that this was being conservative...we could only finish one and the other two looked untouched. You get a HUGE amount of food for extremely reasonable prices. I am actually going to make this a weekly meal prep option because it is as healthy and cheaper than making my own food.

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that Groupon was offering a deal where $15 bought you $30 worth of lunch, so I knew it was time to try it out.

I brought my dad down to the restaurant, and the first thing we noticed was super-small amount of parking available for the restaurant. It looked as though there were only four spaces available, though I'm unsure if the two nearby parking garages and valet are solely available for the apartment building, or are also available for restaurant patrons. That's where the dissapointment ended with our visit.

We walked into the restaurant and were amazed at how nice it looked inside. It had that classic Vegas atmosphere, a little dark and elegantly dressed, though not TOO elegant.

We were seated by the bartender, and waited on by his wife, who were both charming and extremely friendly. 

Our waitor brought us some EXCELLENT bread and butter, as well as a complimentary lentil soup and Caeser Salad (sans Chicken), and everything was WONDERFUL.

We also ordered some Garlic Bread ($3.50) as an appetizer, and were really pleasently surprised. It was definently chock full of garlic, but had a nice blend of cheese and butter as well.

For our main course, my dad ordered the lasagna ($13) and I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese ($13), which were both AMAZING. I especially enjoyed the Bolognese because it was made with both beef and veal, which actually made it taste similar to Osso Bucco. Both of the plates were so large that we were stuffed sufficiently by the end of the meal, and neither of us needed to eat dessert or dinner that night.

I would DEFINENTLY recommend this place to any Italian-food fans, though it surely is better to go at lunch rather than dinner-time. The prices are doubled, and the menu is actually surprisingly not as appetizing.",2,UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA

There, I said it. It feels good. 

Seriously, though. I loved this place. I loved getting my hand stamped like I was going to a concert or fair. I loved walking through the gravel and rows of cars and feeling that terrifying sinking feeling in my stomach because I knew I'd get lost. I didn't love thinking about how those poor cars died or how their owners felt when it happened, but I tried to keep that out of my head as much as possible. I loved looking up the cars in the computer and getting the slip of paper with all of the information on it, then using it as a map all over the yard. It was entirely not what I expected and such an adventure! 

We came for a wide variety of pieces and parts for 2 different cars. The man's VW and my Honda both need some work; the difference between the two is that the VW is a for-fun-beater that he's trying to fix up and play around with, my Honda is my every day car that I'm forcing not to become a beater. I've given the little guy a name and love him like a family member, so the junkyard may be my most frequented spot soon.

My current crush is their bulk section. Almost anything bulk good you need, you can get it there.  If it's not there, just ask...they might be able to order it. I've been doing a ton of sourdough baking lately and I can always find the flour and other things I need. The bulk goods turn over fast, so everything is fresh - especially the spices.  

Love their cheese too, but it doesn't love me...that doesn't mean I don't walk by there every time and ogle their selection. Don't get me started on their cheese orphans: leftovers from the cuttings that allow you to try some great cheeses for not a lotta dough. 

I also highly recommend the tasting and classes. I've only been to a couple, but they've been very informative

I will also mention that it topped out around 112 degrees that day as well, so keeping me happy all day wasn't an easy task.

The summer rate is awesome, via Golfnow.com we got a tee time at 11:36 a.m. for only $35 (including tax) per person. It also included a cart and as many range balls as we could handle. 

Once we arrived I quickly remembered we were at one of the nicest resorts in Arizona. People around to help with anything and everything. 
When we got there the guy outside got our cart ready to go while we checked in with the shop inside. When we came back the clubs were set, he had loaded the ice chest with water (complementary) and ice, made sure we had everything we needed and sent us on our way. Not before letting us know that we could take our time at the range, as there weren't many people out today so we could tee off pretty much whenever we wanted. 

We hit a few balls then to the first tee we went. I didn't play any of the holes, I was the birthday boys caddy for the day. So basically I sat in the cart, in the shade, looked pretty and pulled the pin every now and then. They had no issue with me just riding along, and I didn't have to pay. So awesome! 

The course is beautiful! Looks just as immaculate as I'm sure it does during the cooler months. The views were amazing too! We played too 9 hole courses, Oasis and Canyon. Both awesome. Oasis has a lot of water around it and really lush and green. Canyon was further up the mountain a bit, great too look out on the city. 

The drink/snack cart chica came around several times, loaded us up withmore ice and water. We were very thankful for that!

When we were finished, the golf dude washed his clubs and kept an eye on them while we went in to grab a cocktail at the bar. 

Thank you Phoenician! We will be back! maybe not when it's $250 a round, but we will be back.",2,36uY0YLHy70zR7YoXLUKSA

(see above) I'm told that it is pretty packed during lunch.    We ate outside, so I can't really comment on the interior.  From what I saw, it has a sleek modern look.  The patio outside is small but the tables are well spaced and you are under an overhang to help keep the sun directly off of you. Which is awesome for those of us who shave their heads. (It's a lifestyle choice, dagnabbit)

I asked the server what they recommended and got a few good recommendations along with the suggestion that I had to try the African Peanut Stew.  Who am I to disagree?  So I got that and their BLT while my friend got their veggie big mac. Which is exactly what it sounds like, a big mac, but totally vegetarian.  

A word before I go on. The server brought an entire bottle of water for our table so we could serve ourselves. For those of you who have had the unique pleasure of dining with me, this was the 2nd best thing that a server could do. (the 1st being ""our meal is on the house"" of course)   

The peanut stew arrived and was delicious.  I found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl wishing for more, when I remembered I had ordered the small version.  Damn my fastidious calorie counting.  The flavor is heavy on peanut, but mixes in curry as well.  My friend and I split our sandwiches, so I had both the BLT and veggie big mac. I loved the presentation of the veggie big mac and thought it was delicious, but overall I thought the BLT was a bit tastier.  The egg and toasted bread being the standouts for me.

Service was quick and attentive, but again as the only ones there, I cannot say it is always like this. In a complete stunner for myself, no alcohol was ordered so I cannot comment. 

I went back and forth between 4 & 5 stars for Pura Vida. But really, the 4 stars would only have been because when I got there at 6:30 on a weeknight ,the place was completely deserted.  That doesn't seem fair, so five stars it is.

First, the discounts of course, and then for findng me a really great Optometrist with such an awesome staff! I've seen the YESnick groupon quite frequently, so if you need your eyes check and need new glasses or contacts, I suggest you buy the offer! The groupon deal when I purchased it was $50 for an eye exam (no insurance) and either $250 off glasses or $50 off contacts. 

When I went in for my eye exam, I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff. It wasn't just the simple ""Hi, welcome.."" They actually asked how I was doing, and tried to engage in a conversation with me. When I met with Dr. Yesnick, he did the typical eye exam procedure. What made the experience more special was that as he was checking my eye, he would explain what was being checked and why it needed to be checked -- very thorough so I understood what state my eye was in. 

My astigmatism is really strong in my left eye and he didn't have the type of contacts I needed so he sent me off with a trial pair that could at least fit my right and somewhat my left and had me come back in a 1-2 weeks when the other pair came in. As I was leaving, he asked what type of solution I used and immediately sent someone to grab me a full bottle of solution to take home. A really good first-time experience.

When I came back to get fitted with the new pair, I received the same great service. And before my 3rd visit, I decided I was going to go with glasses. I remembered skimming their collection and they didn't have any frames I liked. I happened to find some Ray-Bans online that I was interested in and called in to ask if they could order the pair for me to try. They immediately made the accommodations (it depends on whether or not their manufacturer has them) and called me to come in to try on as soon as they arrived.

And choosing the Mirage to spend four glorious nights in was the right choice. From booking six months in advance, to check in, to check out and everything in between, I was constantly happy with the service of the hotel, the quality of the accommodations, and the overall experience.

The rooms are classy, very modern, very clean, and spacious.

The last few times we came, there was always an issue...while it's nice they are putting in new seating, the seats are not good for shorter legs. I guess the idea is you put the footrest up, but not everyone wants to do that.  Once it's up, it's extremely hard to adjust, whether going too far or not enough or not doing anything at all...seats shouldn't have to come with instructions.  

The new bar area is nice but it eliminated a bathroom.  You'd think with being down to only one bathroom in the lobby, it would be cleaner, but it wasn't.  

The snack bar area is always a mess in the self serve areas.

I preferred getting tickets at the booths outside.  Even if someone is working the entrance inside, they make you use the machines now & I don't normally bring reading glasses to the movies....also don't like touching the same screens everyone else has on line, always feel I have to wash my hands afterwards. 

Lastly with 30 theaters, why they have only a few showings & limit so many shows to reserved seating is the biggest inconvenience & has us going to harkins instead.  We're just not feeling this place anymore. It was so much better before they went & changed everything.",1,2622JJKxKC25zNky_JpCAA

Prices are a bit higher compared to other locations and meals don't come with soup and drinks. For this prime real estate a few minutes from Dundas Square, it makes sense. 

I did not notice a difference in quality from food here to what you can find in Markham. On this visit we ordered the hainanese chicken and baked chicken steak with black pepper sauce. 

Hainanese chicken: chicken was really well cooked, had the a nice soft texture and rice was very flavourful. I really enjoyed the 2 sauces that came along with the dish. 

Chicken steak: huge portions and very well cooked. Black pepper sauce was a bit on the peppery side and lacked some acidity. 

I will definitely be making return visits to try out the other dishes with friends and coworkers. 

Drink menu is also similarly prices with Markham locations. Yin yang( coffee and tea with milk ) was only 2.50 so I will be visiting here for take out drinks occasionally as well:)",1,lVs0rdBAqSXo2uH45Lp_tA

I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.

This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.

Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.

Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.

This was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! 
The padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! 

I was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the sautéed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! 

For dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my ""classy"" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!

The food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out.

My girlfriend Kristen and I found it quite enjoyable too hahah!  Look at the photos; it was the only table in the corner facing the 'waterfront' with two walls of windows.  

I highly recommend the bacon/spinach chopped salad!!! Yumyum!  I don't recommend the small salad bar for $16.99!!!! I do want to try their Cesar salad, it looks quite delicious.  I don't recommend the soup sampler...save your self the hassle and just order a full bowl of the lobster bisque or the clam chowder.  

The Calamari is called Calamari & Friends...get it without the friends!  It comes with fried vegetables mixed-in (carrots, peppers etc).  I personally like my veggies fresh, not fried and my calamari lonely with lemon :) They did accommodate my preference when I asked for plain, lightly breaded and fried calamari.  And they did not over fry it to death like many places do in the valley.  

I have eaten at Chart House a few times with my friend Kristen and she has gotten the crab cake every time, so I think it is safe to assume it is delicious!  I have had many of their fish dishes (halibut, mahi mahi, and salmon) and all have been good.  Nothing particularly stood out, but it was all great to eat which is why I come back.  Good seafood can be a rough find in the desert.  

Service here is a bit dicey, you never know what you are going to get, some are better than others.  I also always feel like they are trying to hard sell me on more food, which annoys me.  Many times when I opt for seafood I am trying to eat 'lighter' and I don't need somebody hounding me to eat a four course meal.  

I have had the lava cake here once and I give it two thumbs up!  It is quite large for a lava cake too so you can definitely share....if you want :)

So with family in the hospital and absolutely no time to spare, I called and asked, ""Is there a chair available?"" The woman responded, ""Yes, but I can't predict when someone is going to walk in the door.""

I said, ""Can I make an appointment?"" She replied, ""Yes, when would your like a haircut?""

""As soon as possible,"" I replied. ""OK, come on in,"" she said. I immediately jumped in my car and drove the five minutes to the barber shop. I walked in the door to find both chairs filled and two or three guys waiting.

""Did I just talk to you on the phone about an appointment?"" I said. She snarled, ""I TOLD you I couldn't predict when someone would walk in the door."" So much for the appointment.

The end result is (1) the web site is obviously false, (2) the woman either doesn't understand the concept of an appointment or she is ""challenged"" by the concept of business ethics, and (3) I'm not willing to sit in chair while someone who can't handle something as simple as a promised appointment is holding something as sharp as a razor.

They must have a gotten a great deal on these crab legs because I was barely able to get anything out of them. When I did get some crab meat it was falling apart and stringy. It's a shame these crabs gave their lives to have most of their meat thrown away. I moved onto the muscles and clams, thinking they had to be better. Now, I know all of these things come from the sea, but they were the fishiest tasting specimens I've ever had. Again, a waste of a living organism. Finally, I gave the fruit a shot.

When we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.

We started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.

First up were two starters--warm tripe ""alla""Romana and country style paté.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The paté, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The paté was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.

For the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.

For main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.  

For dessert, M ordered the chocolate budino and I ordered a special--peaches and cream.  M's budino was made more like a soufflé and the chocolate could have been richer.  The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.

After dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  

Service was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!

After walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food.",12,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q

If you haven't been to Five Guys before, here's the deal.  The patties are allegedly fresh and never frozen, and I think this is true, because their raw patties are bright red.  Also, they are griddled burgers--not char broiled.  There is a huge difference here.  Griddled burgers are cooked on a flat top, kind of like breakfast, and it cooks in its own fat.  If done right, as they do here, it should have a nice ""crust"" outside, and it should be juicer than char broiled.  What you lose, of course, are the grill marks and the smell of fat drippings hitting the heating element and smoking back up.  It is a matter of preference on which is better.  Five Guys makes some of the best griddled burgers though.

Five Guys takes special pride in their fries.  I think they are a bit dry.  Too much starch has been removed, in my opinion.. thought that wouldn't be possible, but it is true here.  Their cajun fries are not good.  It is something that they sprinkle on afterwards, not while frying.  It is the typical cajun seasoning that you can buy at grocery stores (paprika, oregano, cayenne, cumin, etc).

Some things to keep in mind while ordering:

1.  Little = 1 Patty,  Regular = 2 Patties
2.  Regular Fries = Feeds 2,  Large = Feeds 3-4
3.  There is no discount for getting a ""combo"".

A cheese burger combo will hit you up nearly 15 bucks after taxes.  Yikes.  Sure it is quality meat and all, but places like South Street Burgers can do grass fed burgers for less.  What gives?  It's a piece of Americana, but with price in mind, I can only give it 3 stars.",7,UF7FVT5BFjU2C7nvJNjlRA

I got an acrylic pink/white ombré set by Quinn and love how they look.  We will definitely return back again, the only con I can mention right now is that we had to wait for awhile in between services because of how busy they were and not enough nail techs.

craving something out of the norm like Chili's or Apple Bee's. Remembering an authentic
Tuscan restaurant my best friend is always raving about called Brio, I decided to finally give
in and try it out. When I first arrived I discovered the restaurant was located right in the middle 
of an outside mall area where everything was condensed, giving it that downtown feel, which
I liked. Walking through the door I felt immediately out of place. The décor and just the plain
feel of the restaurant gave a high class first impression. Instantly I was greeted by the hostess
and asked if I wanted an indoor or patio table. Since it was a perfect day outside I opted for the
outdoor table. Looking at the menu I could see that this was going to be a more expensive trip 
than eating at a Chili's. Items on the menu were ranging from $17-$25, but as I always say the 
more expensive the item the better it probably is. After about five minutes of looking at the menu
I was greeted by my waiter bearing gifts of hot delicious bread and a plate of butter. Ordering a
lasagna with bolognese sauce and a diet coke, I eagerly dug into the piping hot bread that was in 
the middle of the table. Within a few minutes the waiter had brought out my salad that came with 
my meal and made sure everything was copasetic. Grabbing my fork and taking the first bite I
realized this wasn't a salad one could get anywhere. The taste was a blend perfection mixed with 
creamy ranch, fresh olives, and croutons. The lettuce was cold and crisp, croutons were just the 
right level of crispness, olives seemed fresh and didn't have that nasty after taste like when I get
them from Subway, and the ranch whether it was from a bottle or in a package tasted like it was
freshly made that day. The main course arrived just as I finished my last bite of salad, like my
waiter was diligently watching until I had my fill of the salad. As he laid the steaming hot plate
of lasagna on the table he asked me if I would like some fresh parmesan cheese on the top. ""Of
course good sir"", I replied. The plate that lay before me was a lot bigger than I anticipated, about 
12 inch plate with a bigger than expected rectangle shaped piece of lasagna smack dab in the 
middle, covered with marinara sauce around the sides of the lasagna and bolognese sauce on the 
middle. The sight and the aromas coming from this glorious plate of lasagna was making my
mouth water. Taking my first bite I relished in the extraordinary taste of sausage, fresh ricotta
cheese, marinara sauce and a variety of spices which blended perfectly together to make one
fantastic dish. From the moment I walked into Brio Tuscan Grille, to the moment I paid my tab
and left, the experience as well as the food was well above par. I shall be returning many, many 
times in the future.",0,6iElR23tamv4iDLqVpxgOg

As it is right now, you can gamble more cheaply here than any casino in Las Vegas.  The $1 craps table alone is worth the drive down to Henderson.  If you are just learning the game, or on a tight budget (i.e., married), this is your place!  Over the last ten years some of my most memorable gambling experiences have happened at this craps table.  Weird, wild stuff.

I rarely play craps anymore. These days I like to play roulette. If you like roulette, this is your place!  The minimum bet is $1, a mere fraction of anywhere else. And they have .10 cent chips, so you can bet like crazy and have all kinds of fun. 

This casino is sort of an on the job training venue for the Boyd gaming company.  The employees are always engaging and helpful.  It is a pleasure to play here. 

Yeah, it's smoky.  Yeah, it's divey. And yeah, it's packed with old geezers.  

But so what?  This is the cheapest place to gamble in the whole Las Vegas area.  Your gambling dollar will go much farther here than anywhere else in town.

I can honestly say that there she will take care of u and your future baby with such good care. 


Another person who I would like to give Kudos to is Vanessa the head nurse, she is very sweet and also puts her time and attention to help what so ever.

The down side that I think can happen is Dr. Tabassi being called out for delivery on your day of your appt, but I am sure any one would like to have dr. tabassi immediately when you are about to deliver and I think it is not so bad just reschedule or if you are lucky u will be called in advance if that where to happen before your appointment. 

I know that it isn't very easy to find a great doctor in such a town but this is definitely a Gem stone here in Vegas.

Prior to being served, I did indeed have my doubts about the café given it doesn't officially open to the public until next week, *HOWEVER, the Studio Coffee owner and his team of Baristas HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER when it comes to their specialty coffee drinks!!

Huntersville needs it's own trendy local coffee hangout and I'm glad that someone finally sees the opportunity in that demand! This shop is well on its way to redefining the Downtown Huntersville landscape will have no trouble becoming an essential part of our community long term!! 

One suggestion (in the case that the owner is reading this): given the low foot-traffic of the shop's location and the sole sign on the window, I'd suggest better roadside advertisement to increase the visibility of the coffee shop! ~If I hadn't been going to the pizzeria across the street for lunch this afternoon, I honestly don't know if I would've ever stumbled upon this neat little coffee shop -- though I'm definitely glad that I did!",2,eWygfmEUrkfxH8_c5CEL6w

I have not recieved a hair cut this precise ever; they use scissors and a razor to ensure that you don't have random hairs sticking out, shaving your neckline with a razor (the entire perimeter, not just the back) and spend way more time that Great Clips or even Sports Clips.  

The only drawback is that most of the barbers speak Spanish.

There is even a small ""low carb"" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps.  I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious.  I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable.  With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me.  My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that.  For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.

I can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.

All and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.

UPDATE (4/20/08):

I have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?",4,ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw

I am sad that I will no longer be able to stop in for my regular breakfast tacos, since they have changed their hours. I used to stop in right before work, but now they open too late. :(

I usually order carne asada tacos or quesadilla. I ordered a chicken breakfast taco once, the chicken looked to be under cooked. When I returned it and asked for a beef taco instead, they were very apologetic and made sure to get me another taco asap. This is the reason, for the 4 stars instead 5. Raw chicken is usually a deal breaker for me, but I had been there so many times before and had great tacos, that I didn't feel it would be fair to bash them for this one mistake. None of us are perfect, right? 

Their jamaica is usually really good. :D",2,YDW9pzW5XLb4yyBmba2cfw

I ordered 24 mixed shortbread cookies for my office online. I indicated that there's someone with a peanut allergy upon ordering. Mary personally called me to ask about the allergy and indicated that she would separate the nutty shortbreads from the others during packaging. 

I am located in Waterloo, even though Mary indicated that she only shipped to the GTA region on her website, she was able to make an exception for me (upon agreeing that she will not be held responsible if cookies were harmed during delivery). I expected a couple of crumbles during shipment, and I was thoroughly surprised when I received the package. It came with a fragile sticker, bubble wrap, lots of paper stuffing, and each cookie INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED in shrink wrap. Not a single cookie was harmed! Koodos to the delivery company as well, they were able to grab a hold of me, change the delivery address to my company just so I am able to receive the delivery personally instead of waving a tag around and picking it up the next day.

Definitely not ready for dinner nor a heavy meal. Something that would definitely hit the spot and last till dinner in a couple of hours. It's Pizza Time!!!

My friend took me over to DeSano and had been here numerous times. 

Looks can be deceiving. From the outside, looks like a restaurant as you open the doors and walk in... Feels like a brewery with picnic tables spread all over the establishment.  Very casual dining for the whole family. It's like just come as you are. No dress code.

As you walk in, menus are on the counter. Friendly staff ready to take your order as well as answer any of your questions. It's like pizza heaven here. Seeing two ovens right in front of you. Everything is made fresh and all the ingredients are from Italy. All these items are available for purchase so you can make your own pizza. Way cool. 

What I like is the size of the pizza you can order. Two sizes to select from. For two people we got the small and more than enough to share. 

After placing order, we sat down to take in the place. Wow! huge ceilings wonder if this was a textile factory or warehouse for it is so big and spacious. There is a patio and a bar area. Bar is open and staff asks if you like anything. Big Screen TV and Food Show is on for your entertainment.

Staff bought our pizza in a tray all cut up. After we finished, we were looking for garbage bin to throw out used particles. Staff noted just leave trays on table and they will pick up. How cool is that.

Place was not busy for it was after Brunch. So it was fun to hang out and talk to the staff about DeSano and how they make their Neapolitan Pizza.

This was the ABSOLUTE BEST hotel we've ever experienced. The whole stay was amazing. I loved everything about our room and the size of it, the view and the bathroom was impeccable. The bathtub was huge, also inside the shower, a very modern feel.
The view is absolutely breathtaking. Since it's one of the only hotels off of the strip, the view of the strip is amazing. That would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel, many taxi rides. You can walk to the strip, but it's a looong walk. It's better to go across the street to The Rio and take the shuttle from there to Harrah's, that's your best shot. Since there's three hotels that make up the Palms, you'll never really be bored there. The Palms Place is where you should stay (price-wise) for your room, the Palms Casino is just a short walkway from there. The actual casino floor of the Palms isn't extremely impressive, it's smaller than I expected, but of course, it gets the job done for gambling. The restaurants in the Palms are top-notch. N9NE Steakhouse was to-die-for. Best steak I've ever had. They have a cafeteria in the Palms Casino and it comes in handy when you're on your way back to your room for a late night snack. The pizza place in that section of the casino is pretty impressive. We ordered a pizza around 2 in the morning and took it back to our room.
The lovely cleaning room attendants cleaned our room everyday to the extreme, but not so much that I felt uncomfortable with them touching all of our things. And they left presents for us everyday. chocolates, robes, flowers. They really were amazing. 
You can't use your balcony anymore, because you can't use any balcony anymore in Vegas, which is upsetting now, because that would have been beautiful to sit out on at night, but still the view was just as beautiful from the door. 

I really was surprised by all of the bad reviews I read on them before writing this, I really don't even have a complaint and it just seems odd that so many people had such a drastically different experience than us.
