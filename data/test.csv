Alanna was amazing! Very professional and absolutely knows what she's doing. I seriously received at least 10 compliments on my tan, from both spray tan experts and haters. The color was a gorgeous golden, sun-kissed brown without any hint of orange. Plus, unlike all my past tans, Alanna's got the blending technique down -- I didn't have a single streak or blotch. Got my tan on a Wednesday afternoon and was tan for a solid week with mild exfoliating after day 4. As someone who battles skin cancer, Sungun is my new best friend and will be a part of my regular summertime routine! Highly recommend.",2,tUZtqzqE0bIOcLelcR4opg

I ordered the tandoori wings and a side of nan - I never got the nan - it was delivered to the other end of the table and I never saw any of that. Everyone else got their orders but me - I waited 10 more - long - minutes before my 8 little tandoori wings arrived, only to find that they were dried out and so hot with curry that I could only eat one. I was extremely dissappointed to say the least.

My daughter who had her 6 week old baby with her - asked for a small bowl of hot water to place the baby's bottle in (to warm up the milk) - and was told by our server that ""they don't have hot water here"".... Seriously? You're a freakin RESTUARANT and you DON'T HAVE HOT WATER? Finally, after realizing what a pathetic boob he was making himself look like, our waiter brought a small teacup full of warm water to our table.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand to top things off for our excursion to a Triple D rated establishment - ALL TEN OF OUR PARTY GOT SICK FROM THE FOOD WE ATE AT THE CURRY CORNER!!! Maybe they should change their name to the ""Colitis Corner"" - cramps, nausea & vomitting - I lost a day of work due to the food I ate made it impossible for me to go to my job.

This is the seond time I've gone to an establishment that had the old ""As Seen on Diners, Drive ins and Dives"" - Curry Colitis Corner is DEFINATELY A DIVE !!! Be afraid - BE VERY AFRAID !!!!!!!!!!!!",1,at7dS8gtLiEwd_4uHv231A

There are enough restaurants to have enough variety in dining during my traditional 2-3 night stays.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  My only gripe has to do with self-parking.  If you are a guest to the hotel and want to self park, the check-in area is not very convenient as you have to walk through the casino to check-in, then walk back through the casino to get to the elevators for the rooms.  If you valet park, then you won't run into this issue, but I like to save a few bucks and park myself.  However, the Palazzo doesn't have this problem at all.  The parking garage elevator brings you right into the check-in area.  You can also access the Palazzo parking garage from Spring Mtn Rd (exit off the 15 frwy) and avoid driving on the strip.  Palazzo and Venetian are connected and accomodations are very similar.  As I like to self-park and avoid driving on the strip, I'll probably be staying at the Palazzo.",0,dy_4NAZ0KR2bDoB9qAOMRg

I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the ""plenty"" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).

To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.  

I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.  

The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.  I'd not trust them to sell me anything as if this is an indication of how they opperate, you might as well throw your cash into a garbage can and light it on fire.

The first thing you will notice upon entering Burger's Priest is their religious theme menu with selections such as ""High Priest"" and ""The Vatican."" Hopefully the second thing you will notice is that they only accept cash. One of the other patrons in line caught without cash, like us, asked the staff whether they knew it was the year 2016. Why do they only accept cash? I can think of a few reasons but do not want to speculate however considering the prices I found it ridiculous.

Returning to Burger's Priest with cash in hand we both ordered the ""High Priest"" with fries and a drink.

**Disclaimer** if you enjoy such restaurants as Holy Chuck you may wish to take the rest of this review with a grain of salt.

The ""High Priest"" is Burger's Priest version of the Big Mac. An interesting concept because the Big Mac costs roughly $4-5 dollars while the High Priest cost $10. I question whether a ""high end"" burger joint should be trying to replicate the taste of McDonalds. Why would I not just go to McDonald's and pay significantly less money?

The burger meat itself is where I hoped there would be a significant difference. Unfortunately, just like Holy Chuck, I found the beef extremely greasy and soft, basically mushy. I don't care how high grade, organic or fresh the meat is. It is borderline inedible, mushy and excessively greasy.

I ordered the orecchiette with spicy sausage and rapini and it was simple yet delicious. The pasta was cooked al dente, the spicy sausage gave it a perfect kick, and the portion was a good size for lunch -- I wasn't overly stuffed but I felt full by the end of our meal. Even though the restaurant was busy, my dish came out quickly.

The service was friendly and quick. We were able to sit on the patio area so we could people watch. I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas to try other dishes here.",5,LkP5uU4ncr5MgNp8ercSCA

I also had a cappuccino and although I'm not a coffee specialist both the women with me assured me it was very good. 

The only critique I have of the place is that it does not have enough seating. There is only one table inside (we got it) and benches outside.

It was our first time here and it was a very enjoyable experience. Upon entering the resort and driving to the lodge/front desk, you get to see the natural beauty that the Boulders have to offer. Most of the units don't have parking, so you valet or self park (both are covered in the resort fee) at the lodge and then they drive you in a golf cart to where you're staying. There's nothing bad to say about this, as all you do when you need a ride to anywhere on the resort or back to you vehicle is use the phone in your room and they are there to pick you up. I believe the longest wait was around 5 minutes. 

The casita and pretty much all areas of the resort are very nice and clean. The only negative I have to write about that keeps from a 5 star review is:

Lodge pool - the pool entrance was a big turn off, as there were many dead bugs, dirt and some kind of oil/film that covered the top. 

Romance package - the food and drink vouchers were nice, but the sparkling wine really just made me laugh. It was a twist off cap and can be bought at the store for $5.99. While the presentation was nice and who doesn't like having a bottle waiting on ice when you get to your room, it'd be better to bring your own. For a resort of this caliber, I expected slightly better

Poolside service - there were about 15 or so people poolside, but only one waitress, whom also was helping inside. We arrived and waited close to an hour before we received our drinks. Waited to be acknowledged, waited for the waitress to find and menu, and then after ordering was about another 20 to receive them.

Overall, was a very good experience and we will probably be back again, but hopefully will have a 5 star stay",1,Sl89PHC86Bm7zuIbK8zx_g

The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.

I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink. 
Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great.

First, not only did our cheese bread app take forever, but when it finally came, it was cold and dry.  And we couldn't even eat it until the waiter decided to finally bring plates and utensils.  Why this was not done right away, or anytime during the 25 minute wait, I don't know.  I actually got up to go get stuff for us to eat it with, along with salt and pepper that was also not on the table, and as I was coming back to the table, the pizzas were arriving.  WTH?  There were seriously THREE tables in the whole place...thats not even acceptible when a place is actually busy!  And if your app comes within like 3-5 minutes of your appetizer, it should be free!  

Then, we specifically ordered our pizzas with extra cheese because this place has been very light handed with it in the past.

We were there for an hour before my Aunt found you in a room and asked that you come in so that we can speak to you.  When you entered the room you had a horrible attitude and talked down to us in a very condescending manner.

We ate there on more than one occasion and usually got the appetizers (Nachos and Chicken tenders).  Loved the food, a lot more than my husband and I could eat and the waitresses really took care of you even when you were just ordering drinks.  We sat out in the bar part by the mechanical bull and had great sevice even during the busy times.  

Every night they have a special theme, we really enjoyed World Famous Bikini Bull Riding.  There was a DJ and 5 girls rode the bowl and they had promotions where you could get free stuff from their sponsors.  I had a lot of fun both because of what I was drinking and the entertainment.  They have line dancing classes at certain times, you can ride the mechanical bull or just watch others partake in it.  If you want to have a seat you need to get their a little earlier than it starts or if you don't mind standing don't worry about the timing, either way you will enjoy yourselves at Gilley's.  

The waitresses are all dressed cute and they get on the dance floor at times and are very good at the line dances.  They are willing to take pictures with the customers and it makes for a great memory of your trip.  You are encouraged to wear your western wear while you are there, but not required.

When picking up my car at Budget, I was assisted by a supervisor named Roosevelt,  who immediately tried up-selling - which is understandable because it's his job, but he was very rude. I purchased rental insurance through Hotwire, but Roosevelt kept interjecting that i'd be personally liable for damages and that Hotwire's insurance didn't mean anything. He also kept interrupting me and telling me that I needed to purchase Budget's insurance to be covered.

Setting the up-selling aside, the car given to me was a different class/size than promised. My email confirmation from Hotwire said Budget would provide me with a Ford Fusion or similar, however Roosevelt dismissed everything and said I'd have to pay more for a Ford Fusion.

Im excited because this was my first ever live boxing match and my first time ever at T and M. Was all ready to pay for parking but pleasantly found out that you didn't have to. Parking was half full but we had a disabled person with us so we got to park right in front of the arena. 

Like all hyped up epic boxing matches, there are always undercards that go before the main event so that whatever drama that has been building up since its announcement can marinate in everybody's minds. 

Of course, until the main event comes around, the arena is only half full. It's like a party atmosphere until then no matter who is on the undercard. I would say about 3/4 of the crowd were Mexican pulling for Marquez. Lots of Mexican flags being waved around not the mention all the cervezas flowing.

The sound system is nice and loud especially when they play music for introductions and videos played on the big screens. The only bad thing was that when they actually spoke into the mics, it wasn't as loud and not very clear.

What makes this a 4 instead of a 5 star review is not because of the lousy mics, its because of the lousy overall design of the parking lot logistics. Earlier, we were ecstatic because we scored a disabled parking spot. Only problem was that getting out was a total nightmare. Since we were basically parked in front of the entrance of the arena, a massive amount of attendees were all over the place walking back to their car. This was probably the only time that cars did not have the right of way. You had people all over the place walking around like zombies. Yes you had parking attendees directing you where to go but it didn't matter because the people walking around didn't care if you were trying to get out of the parking lot. They just kept on walking like there were no cars at all rolling around. This definitely has to be redesigned. Im sure this is not as bad as a problem at other arenas.

Overall, I had fun up until we had to leave. Maybe next  time we we just wont park so close to the arena. Oh btw, the fight went the full 12 rounds and Bradley won by split decision.",5,0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg

Wow, the apps were good and the mains were amazing. The sweet and bitter salad was really great; a great mix of the two flavours. The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.

I will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. 

The desserts were also very simple; not like ""awesome because it was so simple and amazing"", but like, ""just simple and meh"". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.

We sat on the patio, and it was really cute; birds singing, music playing, leaves and twigs falling on to our table, which made us giggle. The bee was pretty scary, but I seriously recommend the patio.

Server was very busy, so we understood that he wasn't always there. He apologized on his own and he was very courteous. Left a great tip, because I think service at regular times would be fantastic.",0,uDPgnEv6jZa4CSv6NX49TQ

The theater itself is very nice and looks to be recently upgraded. The food court area has two sides as does the hallways featuring the individual theater rooms. Customer service at ticket pick up, entry, and the food area was satisfactory as well.

I am only 12 weeks, so I didn't think I was ready for a maternity store, but my jeans are a little snug, and I didn't want to buy a new pair of regular jeans that would only last me a couple of months tops. My husband and I wandered in and were met by Lisa. She told me that anything I buy now should take me through my pregnancy, so I started grabbing jeans. She also measured me and gave me a bunch of bras to try on.

First of all, I did not know they made designer maternity jeans. The nicest pair of jeans I have is from J Crew, so I guess it took the insecurity of pregnancy bloat to push me over the edge. I also had no idea what a nursing bra was, but they had the same brand as the bras I get at Nordstrom, the only difference is they have clips and a little sling inside the cup. Otherwise, I would have never known the difference. 

Lisa was a huge help throwing me in different sizes. It was also great being able to show her the fit of the jeans and bras to get her feedback on if I needed a different size. My husband and I walked in nervous and dreading the experience, but it turned out being a lot of fun. I ended up spending a small fortune on new jeans and bras, but it was such a relief to walk out of there knowing I am covered now that the weather is getting chilly. The jeans fit so well, and the bras are so awesome, that for the first time in 12 weeks I actually feel half way like a *woman* again rather than just some weird alien baby vessel.",3,zJM2JPFDafXxBRj90r1Klg

We love the option to use the kid area pool or the adult area pool depending on how crowded either one is. The spa in the kids area is large enough that you can sit and have a conversation with your spouse without feeling like you're sitting right on top of the people next to you (large enough for 70 people we're told). The rooms are perfect for the essentials, you have a fully functional kitchen, which is amazing. The bathrooms are spacious and the water pressure in the shower is always great (this is a big deal for me, I hate not being able to get the shampoo out of my hair or getting shot in the eye with a stray stream of water). The adult area pool has a great little bar, and the prices aren't bad. Best part of that is being able to charge it to the room so you don't have to bring your CC to the pool. Great little gym on property. Gorgeous scenery if you want to walk around. Lots of day trips available for a price. There is an actual spa attached to the resort, and I'm sure the treatments are wonderful, but I feel they are a bit pricey. 
My husband loves being able to check out bbq tools and we will usually bbq a nice steak one of the nights we are there. The people at the front desk are always very helpful and if there is an issue with your room they can usually send someone right up.

I sent it back and they bartender explained they were Flame Grilled and was pretty rude to me about it.  Also, on another recent visit I asked for my wings to be cooked well done and/or crispy but they came out barely cooked and were disgusting.  However, I was I did'nt want a run it with the bartender so I ate about 5 and left in a hurry.  I also noticed a few other patrons who sent back their food too, maybe they have a bad chef on Sundays.  

Maybe my dad is right when he calls it the stinking lizard, yes I know cheesy, but this places food really sucks.  Also, there french fries are frozen sysco brand steak fries.  

With all that said, a nice place to grab a beer(Huge Selecetion) but stick with the free popcorn!",0,kEEx6yEf81i9Wk5Ww1q6GA

I'm not going to lie. I sort of judged especially it being by/on frat row. My friend and I sat at the bar and Morgan was super nice and suggested food for us. We ordered the sliders and boy were they amazing. We asked her where they would be showing the Mayweather McGreggor fight. She said right there! Of course right?! So next day rolls around and we get there super early to eat beforehand. Oh yeah food was super good. Beer, good!!! Lol. Morgan was very attentive as well as Chloe. So if you remember the Mayweather McGreggor fight took forever to start so we were literally there for hours. By that time our asses were sore from those seats at the bar. My friend and I were expecting to pay $50 to watch the fight and they didn't charge anything for females! Sweet! Pays to have a vagina! Lol. Had a fun time here with good service.

First,  it was packed, and VERY VERY noisy, I had to shout to talk to my table mates.

Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all.",6,G_xEDEkC4z0G_ZLFWGPFEg

Chicken and waffles were awesome, however wish the waffles were a little crispier.

All that's left is the sad remnants of their burger menu as drably interpreted by a Guatemalan restaurant using subpar ingredients and fast food execution. 

Clue #1: We were literally the only ones there during dinnertime on a Saturday.

Clue #2: More than half the place was set up as an even sadder attempt at a Latin club (see photo). Again, exactly zero people present, other than the ""DJ"" and his late middle aged companion. So our disappointing burger meal was accompanied by blasting reggaeton.

The food: The ($18) surf and turf fries were covered in cheezewiz and overnight grocery store guac, with a stingy amount of ""asada"" and 4-5 shrimps. The wings tasted straight from the freezer with salad dressing ranch. The only passable part of the meal was my El Nino burger, which was meh and looked absolutely nothing like photos from the Lab's glory days.

St Clair West seems better..)and this is their go - to spot for brunch. I suggested we go to Brunhworks, but they told me this place was a lot cheaper, so $$$ yes.

We waited about 45 minutes for a table in that super cramped little area. That was a mission and a half on its own..plus the cost of being hungover and it was snowing outside (As usual) so I wasn't the happiest per say.


Anyways, we sat down to a cute booth (super props to them fro having a booth that I actually fit into..super props for that)

We had :

1. The Westtern Sandwich - This was.. okay. The eggs were overcooked for my taste, and there wasn't a top of toppings. The bread could've used some butter, but yea. The boom frites were amazing though. Super super super good.

2. The Chick-a-dilla - This was a a breakfast quesidilla I guess. It was quite tiny I guess, bbut the guac was AWESOME.

3. The Power Breakfast - Standard fare

4. My friend's Omelette.- didn't get to try this.

The place is cute, but the breakfast was under-whelming. The servers were super super cute though.

When we drove the car back to repair the TPMS problem, we were told to come back in 30, no, 45 minutes and it would be done, as well as adjusting the tire pressure appropriately.  We came back in an hour and they had not even touched the car.  Of course they apologized profusely, but still, a truly incompetent mistake.  The tire sale came with free realignments for three months, so my wife took the car back in the other day for her final alignment.  During that process they managed to screw up something and the Traction Control System light came on and it took them 3 hours, yes, 3 hours to figure out what was wrong and ""fix"" it.  The light is now out, but I don't know if they actually fixed the problem or just found out a way to turn the light off permanently, which can be a major safety concern.

First of, if I'm ordering Crepes from a place that has plentiful desserts, I expect the fruits to be sweet and ripe. 
I ordered the basic Crepes with strawberries and chocolate. 

Sadly $10 dollars did not provide me with sweet strawberries. Rather, I received what seemed to be frozen, watery, un ready strawberries. They were even pale in colour. 
This completely ruined the experience for me, as I am a Crepes lover!
The size was not even that big, and they did not put enough chocolate on the top to balance out all the bitter tasteless strawberries. 

I expected more from a place whose supposed to provide specialty dessert.

We headed in around 12:00 and were basically ambushed. We were greeted, sat, had our drinks ordered and chips and salsa were on the table within less than one minute. So right off the bat I can say that this is a great place if you're in a rush for lunch! But I wasn't in a rush, so I felt a bit pushed through the meal. The chips were fresh and crisp, and both salsas were pretty good (you get a mild, liquidy salsa and a spicy thick salsa). 

The food is very affordable and comes out pretty quickly (a little too quickly for me.) They had a special of the day for $5.00 and majority of the basic combinations on the lunch menu were $5.50. I ordered the #5 combo which consisted of a taco, enchilada and rice. The taco was pretty darn amazing. What really did it for me was the fresh-made shell. This isn't the usual hard shell you find at most places...it's a puffy, crisp holder of goodness. The ground beef (you can also choose chicken) was really flavorful and packed with spices and some kind of pepper (either bell or jalapeno, I couldn't tell since it was chopped pretty fine.) It also came topped with lettuce and some kind of white cheese...I don't know what it was but it wasn't your run of the mill cheddar. The enchilada was also very tasty, and huge! It had the same ground beef as the taco and was covered with a tasty sauce and cheese. The enchilada was cooked perfectly and made for a pretty darn good lunch item. Then came the part of the lunch that was most disappointing...the rice.

I don't want to trash this wonderful restaurant for messing up a single little side item, but when it is a Mexican restaurant with lame rice, then that's just not cool with me. I could actually tell it wasn't going to be good when it came out because it was all kind of mushed together. The rice was definitely waaaaay overcooked and I just detest mushy rice. Not only was it overcooked, but I think the flavor got cooked out of it as well, as it was fairly bland. 

The miss' went with the #1 combo which had a taco, chili relleno, guac salad and refried beans. She went with the chicken taco and it was a flavorful, tender shredded bit of meat. The chili relleno was a bit different as it is entirely surrounded by a mass of scrambled egg. The egg was good, and the chili stuffed with chicken and cheese was pretty darn tasty. If anything, the egg made it a bit much in terms of richness but it was a very good chili relleno (sure beat Monterys.) The guac definitely tasted like it was just made and was very refreshing, with a bit more lime bite than usual. The beans were right on par with other beans I've had...pretty great but nothing too fancy or special.

All in all, I enjoyed the meal very much and will most certainly go back. Despite being a tad bit rushed (I'm assuming it was due to the time we went) and the lame rice, it was definitely some top-notch Mexican. And I definitely have to say that they have some of the best tacos I've ever had...those shells and the ground beef crammed in there is the stuff dreams are made of.

The movie watching experience here just lacks something, but it makes up for it by having all their cinemas in digital quality, I enjoy the popcorn here (but lack of shakers is a downer for me), I wish they had a bit more range when it comes to the concession stand, it IS in the heart of the city. 

The system is a little unusual with the box office located 3 stories below the theatre, with automated machines at both locations. And as someone that comes here around twice a week, I am more familiar with their loyalty program than most people that work the box office, which is a little frustrating having to explain their own system to them, but the staff at the customer desk are always very friendly.

The midnight release experience here is clearly inferior to that at Scotiabank as they cannot accommodate large lines inside, and had people lining up in the food court for the Harry Potter release, it was the same for tiff, rush lines would be in the food courts and it gets confusing very fast. 

The IMAX experience at first glance seems less impressive than what I'm used to, but after a few trips to both this and the Scotia one, I'm coming to realise the disparity is not as large. 

Their ETX seems larger than the Scotiabank Ultra experience, but the lack of seat assignments makes this lose out on that front. 

If you watch a movie (even if it's once a month or so) it makes so much sense to sign up for their loyalty program which trumps the scene due to the reduced ticket prices, although the rewards come in smaller portions than Scene's, but AMC provides free popcorn via emailed coupons every Monday - Thursday if you pay attention to their emails. 

But this is a massive complex, their movie options are questionable at times (having 3 Indian movies playing in the same time period for e.g.) but it does deliver on the quality front which is enough for me.",5,9W73B44Iw8WslrTNB2CdCg

Before, I was making a transition from Planet Fitness to LA. I'm sure some of you have gone through this as well when you hit a wall in your fitness journey. That's how I felt at PF, so I knew I needed a change. I began to look at the Robinson location closest to my home. It didn't take me very long to come to a decision. At the time there was a promotional going on for $0 down and all I needed to pay up front was my 1st and last months monthly fee. 

Once I got my membership set up it was finally time to hit the gym! First thing you notice coming in is all the cardio machines; treadmills, bikes and ellipticals were on the bottom floor. Along with a studio room w/ punching bags, and a spinning class room. Of course the pool as well. Then when you head upstairs are all the weights and lifting machines. Overall, a pretty big gym which took me some time to get used to where everything was and getting the most out of my workouts. 

Fast forward to now, I really enjoy this location LA. The staff is nice and courteous. The equipment is well kept and clean, along with the locker rooms and sauna area.

The server was on point and the pizza was some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. The crust was nice thin and airy. Probably will be a must have every time I want pizza in Vegas. We also had wings. They were good. They have their own flavor combinations for their wings. So thats was a plus. I like to experience different and new things. This was definitely a  pleasurable one. Give it a go.

This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza. 

I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. 

One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with).

I waited about 10 minutes, no more than I feel like I would've waited had I made an appointment. The vet assistant was wonderful and helpful. The vet, Ms. Ruiz was also very friendly and informative.

It's hard to find Vietnamese restaurants with so many vegetarian and vegan options so I think this place definitely works well for that.

À ma deuxième visite, ce fût moins concluant. 
La nourriture était très bonne dans l'ensemble, pas vraiment rien à redire la-dessus honnêtement. Très bien réussi.
Par contre le service.. Si vous prenez le steak, vous ne pouvez pas choisir la cuisson: c'est saignant, pas moyen de l'avoir medium. À prendre un bon steak au restaurant, ça serait la moindre des choses de laisser les clients choisir leur cuisson.
Le service était in-ter-mi-na-ble. Ça a pris environ 30 minutes recevoir la seule entrée commandée, soit un plateau de charcuteries.. On s'entend, il y avait 2 petits trucs à frire et le reste, c'était simplement du ""plating"".. Ensuite pour les plats principaux, on a du attendre un bon 45 minutes après avoir terminé l'entrée. Et la cuisine est à aire ouverte, on la voit depuis les tables: les cuisiniers n'avaient pas l'air rusher pour deux cents, ils jasaient et rigolaient avec les clients au bar.. 
Jamais de retour de la serveuse pour nous demandé si l'entrée ou les repas étaient à notre goût. On s'est servis nous-même notre vin toute la soirée.
Factures qui sont arrivées avec des erreurs, malgré qu'on avait 4 items pour 3 personnes.. 
Malheureusement, un excellent service peut rattraper une nourriture moyenne, mais un service tel que l'on a reçu, malgré la bonne nourriture, fera en sorte que nous retournerons pas.

The tofu with seafood was okay - wish there was more of a fresh tofu taste, and wish there were more seafood bits in the soup. The pork bone soup was somewhat better as it seemed to be boiled for a long time, allowing the soup to absorb more of the flavor.

But, (YEAH!!!) they will be expanding soon which means there will be lots of construction and an even tougher time finding a parking spot but it will be worth it in the end. I too was someone who tried out Bloom only to be disappointed in their prices but this is about HT.

I like the selection of fruit & veggies and found many organic options which I loved. The meat aisle offers little more then the expensive Angus Beef options but if you look around you can pretty much find what you want. I have never special ordered meat there but I'm sure they are more than willing to take care of your needs.

The deli section has a great variety of lunchmeats and cooked meal options and even have a smaller sized make your own salad bar. I would love to grab more lunches there freshly made but the parking almost makes it impossible to get in and out and back to work in a reasonable amount of time. 

Their frozen food section is getting much better. I spoke with the Mgr. about 2 weeks ago asking about a new item I wanted to try and yesterday when I went it was there along with another item I had told him I liked but never found in the store. 

If you coupon clip and get the e-Vic card then you can definitely find some great deals. I really like this store and the weekly deals and specials, if scheduled by me right, fit well within my budget. With coupons I saved quite a bit of money on their weekly specials.

As far as equipment, they have modern machines and a good variety and quantity. Even during busy times, I have always been able to find equipment or machines to work out. 
The classes are great too. I started in 2007 with Zumba and got hooked to coming to the gym everyday. I have also tried water aerobics, cycling, and a group weight training class. I really enjoyed all of them. The instructors were knowledgeable and made the classes fun. 
The cafe is excellent! I love the food! It's fresh and very healthy. My kids beg me to eat there every time I take them. I love the California chicken and the protein smoothies. 
The pools are excellent! My kids love the water slides and when it gets too cold, they really enjoy using the inside pools! I also enjoy the saunas, the steam room and the jacuzzis. Seriously, lifetime it's my second home! There's so much to do, I could spend hours there!

       Extended Warranty offered by Spencer's:  AWFUL
I have purchased many appliances from Spencer's over the years for my home and two rental properties.  Their prices are very competitive with other stores.  Their salespeople are some of the most knowledgeable out there.  I know that extended warranties are usually not worth the money, but I don't want the hassle, and Spencer's does have the best prices if you do want to buy an extended warranty.
When I bought a new refrigerator for my own home a couple of  years ago, I purchased the 5 year extended warranty, for fear that I would have trouble with the in-door icemaker. 
Sure enough, the icemaker went out in May, 2015.  Only one adult uses the icemaker, so it is certainly not abused.  I called the warranty company that handles this.
     THIS WARRANTY COMPANY HAS BEEN TO MY HOUSE ELEVEN TIMES SINCE LAST MAY!  They have repaired or replaced just about every  part in my freezer.  At Thanksgiving (2015), they asked me to empty my freezer and defrost it, so they could replace a water line they believed was frozen.  I had to ask two neighbors if I could borrow some freezer space for a few days (this during Thanksgiving).  Not enough freezer space from the neighbors, so a lot of my food went into ice chests on the patio (some food just didn't make it).  After all of this, THAT repair did not work either.
They kept trying something new at each visit.  Each repair did not work.  Still no ice.
Finally, in early January, warranty company says they have tried everything.  They will order me a new door.  A new door??!??!?!  They PROMISED me a new door would take care of the problem. But, I would have to wait 2 months for Whirlpool to ship a new door.  I really like my refrigerator (I just want it fixed!!), so dumb me says OK.   In March (2016)  - Warranty company calls and says my new door is in (I have a side-by-side refrigerator).  FINALLY!  My nightmare will be over, and my every-other-day trip to the store for ice will end.  I can't wait.
Warranty company shows up and says ""Uh-oh. We ordered you a stainless-steel door, instead of black.  We are sorry.  You will need to wait ANOTHER two months for the correct door to be shipped from Whirlpool.""  When (or IF) I ever get the correct door, and IF that works, it will have been a total of ONE YEAR since I first reported my icemaker not working.
        In defense of the warranty company, the repair techs. have seemed truly sympathetic, and are very nice. But, this warranty policy is the worst.  (I happened to be in Sears the other day - they said their policy is to replace the ENTIRE appliance if it could not be fixed after 3 attempts to repair.)  
        My recommendation:  If you want just an appliance without any warranties, Spencer's has great prices and knowledgeable salespeople.  But, if you want to purchase an appliance with a warranty, you may want to shop around.  DO NOT buy the extended warranty from Spencer's.",5,c8ycEpcve95dIbUcWtHGJA

This awesome spot is open 24 hours a day right smack dab in the middle of the amazing Caesars Palace. Not too big and not to small, we came in late night for a bite. In all honesty, I was a bit hungover from the night before. I ordered the dumplings, they are made to order, by hand and took a little longer to hit the table. My family ordered two beef stew, Kung Pao Chicken (no peanuts) and a pancake wrap. Excuse me that I don't remember the fine details. It's Vegas, I had a bit too much fun the night before and I really wanted to crawl back into bed. 
When our food came, literally- the heavens opened and the choir of angels sang. My dumplings were amazing little purses of flavor. My sister was able to share a slice of this pancake that immediately made me regret my choice as well. The stew, with it's hand pulled noodles, rich beefy broth soothed me. And my dad, his Kung Pao chicken.. to die for. I came to life. Suddenly, I was okay and thought to myself, this is a bit of heaven. I wish I had ordered more. 
After getting home, I found a few celebrity/ food network shows that had visited and sang praises to this place. They were right on the money. If you want, authentic Chinese cuisine- go here and take a chance. They take pride in making food that pleases your soul. No, it's not American-ized. It's good Northern Chinese food, done right and good in a small, but delicious space. The staff is super friendly (my sister had fun taking photos of the girls making noodles) and willing to help you choose something you will like. No shortcuts. Seriously good food made from scratch, authentic and they don't mind if you want a few tweaks to fit your taste. Relax, good food takes a little more time so use those extra minutes to smile, talk to your friends and just breathe.

It was.

This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing. 

I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice.

The burrito itself is 3 stars but everything else about Sneaky Dee's is 4 stars.

The burrito was very bland as it was just meat and refried beans with cheese melted on top (yeah I know that's the traditional Mexican way but I'm going to bitch about it anyways).  The plate came with rice and a ""salad"" which was a great addition to give the meal some flavour.

The vegan pumpkin cupcakes were awesome (for a vegan cupcake).  The service was pretty good but not anything worth cheering for.  The beer specials were great also ($3.95 for a pint).",3,YRcaNlwQ6XXPFDXWtuMGdA

We came back for our anniversary and were quite disappointed. We found out all pools and hot tubs were closed and it was nothing that came up while making our reservation on their website. Apparently it was noted in a side link about their pools but because we stayed here before, we weren't reading all the side links. That is a huge amenity to not have available and its a big part of why we came since my husband is recovering from a back injury and we looked forward to utilizing it often during our multiple day stay. We are quite deflated at not having better communication about such a large amenity being gone. We drove over 5 hours just to stay here and we were going to book an additional night this weekend but will be looking else where. The front desk didn't answer our call and when I went to the front desk, they had nothing to contribute to a better stay for our anniversary.

They also guaranteed their prices and said if I found the same service for a lower price, they will match it.

My second experience was with my husband and he took his 2003 Honda Civic in for a water pump replacement and timing belt replacement.  They were very friendly and efficient and even honored our coupons from the website. They also offered price matching on this service.

Thankfully, I only have one prescription I have to deal with and just have to go by once a month. But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is ""Be right with you"".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on. 

The drive-thru pickup, if it doesn't have a long-line is slightly better for some reason. Not personable at all but at least a bit quicker.

I had already been there for 5 plus hours and was super tired and hungry but who would have thought the price would have changed so drastically? So once I went into finance to sign, I thought it was so weird that he did not go line by line over the charges like new car price, trade value, negative equity you have to carry, rebates, how many years the terms are for, and final payment ( iahve bought about 5 cars in last 10 years and NEVER have they not gone over every line in finance) but I was so tired its 9:30pm by this time so when he knowingly slides the paper work just right to the bottom to sign it kinda triggered me the next day and I said you know what I need to review all my paper work.

The straps on this bag are made of 3 strands braided together; two are leather but one is a kind of mesh chain, and this is what snapped in half. The whole strap needed to be re-braided and the mesh chain re-attached, and since it's metal it couldn't be glued. Somehow, they managed to re-connect the chain and wrap it with a thin band of black leather to match the rest of the bag; the repair is barely visible, and my favorite bag is back on my arm! They also strengthened a couple of places where the mesh had lost a few links in the same way. I'm so happy to have my bag back and the price for the repair was only $30 - more than reasonable, especially since it sounds like it was a lengthy and tricky repair.

Keeping in mind my last experience, I expected this to be a tasty deli lunch experience. Ummmm jokes on me I guess. Everybody's food was SO BLAND. You know how the best food is the restaurant food that taste homemade, but honestly you know you could never compare if you actually made it at home? That is what I wanted, but did not get. ARGHHHH. 

My brisket wrap did not have any horseradish despite the menu saying it would. I choked on the meat it was so dry. And the chicken salad was mostly egg salad. IF I WANTED EGG SALAD I WOULD ORDER EGG OK?!??? The marinated mushroom was just a chewy mass. Like they just whipped it out of the bunch that they marinated and put it on some bread. Not even grilled. So disappointed!!!

I am still giving two stars because it was fresh, just not good. So learn to work with the quality and you'll be killing the deli game. 

p.s. Sauerkraut balls were good, but probably only because they were fried. They were made with mostly corn beef anyways, not sauerkraut. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!",1,1fBZy5_5CgT9ZK-bpbizLw

I've since left that job but moved closer to Angel's, so I'm basically a Sunday evening regular at this point.

32 beers on tap, plus about 5 wine selections on tap as well. I'm more a stouts and porters girl, but you never know what you'll find at Angel's! IPAs aplenty, stouts, porters, gose, sours, fruit beers, ales of all kinds, a cider or two, and seasonal beers are all common finds. There's usually 2 on the nitro tap, and a rotating selection of a few Arizona beers. 

I mostly sit at the bar when I stop in, and the bartenders are all quite friendly without being overbearing. Some forget to give you a glass of water unless you ask for one, some give you one automatically.

The place is not a sports bar, they have two TVs playing some manner of sporting events (usually football or baseball) with the sound off and closed-captioning. Music is also usually unobtrusive, thanks to their random Pandora offerings. If you're the type who prefers a rowdy, sports-centric bar, Angel's ain't the place for you. If you want a somewhat lively bar with a nice, large patio, extensive beer selection, and solid food options, this is the place.

Oh, the food. Their menu isn't huge, but it delivers in unique-ness. My favorite thing on the menu is the Central, a fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack cheese, bacon, red onion, jalapeño ranch, and cucumber. The cucumber is what makes it, for me. Their fries are quite tasty, thicker than shoestring fries with a house seasoning that may just be seasoned salt for all I know. Be warned -- their ketchup is made in-house, and it's nowhere near the usual Heinz stuff. In my opinion, it would be more complemented by mozzarella sticks than fries, but if you go in knowing it's not your usual ketchup, you might be pleasantly surprised.

I've also tried their soft pretzels app with beer cheese and beer mustard. Very good, light and fluffy hot pretzels. The Outlaw burger is also a solid selection (pretty standard BBQ sauce/bacon/cheese/onion string burger), as is the Matador sandwich (brisket, cheese, horseradish, peppers and onions, if I recall).

We drove all the way from Connecticut to pick up our new trailer, since our sales rep Allen gave us a very competitive deal on a fully loaded new unit we could simply not refuse.  At the time of our pick up, we had plenty of time to do our orientation and the pre-delivery inspection.  From the moment we walked in the door, the receptionist and people on the floor were very welcoming.  The service staff (with particular shout outs to Adon and Andy) was very accommodating and they showed us all the systems inside and out, with water and electric hooked up, including the AC.  I was also pleased they went over the hitch setup process with great detail.  Since I am new to towing, one of the staff rode with us around the city neighborhood to get a sense of how the rig would handle, how to handle turns, braking, backing up, etc., which was greatly appreciated.  Throughout the entire process, everyone at Tom's was responsive to our many questions and concerns.

We spent 10 nights in the Mesa vicinity at two lovely desert parks, Usery Mountain and Lost Dutchman, for our local shakedown.  Camping there in early April was delightful.

Small and semi-hidden location but definitely packs a flavor punch. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone, including vegetarians! 

The employees are friendly and eager to please, and your poutine comes out relatively quick. 

Whether you are poutine obsessed like me, or have never even heard of it, check this place out. It would be amazing for any meal, and especially after a night downtown drinking. (Or the next morning, they have a hangover poutine...)",29,HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w

When you pay at the register they tell you to ask the warehouse workers to show you the item is the correct and functioning item you purchased. I asked them to take it out the box twice and they refused. Said item was working fine. After taking it home and waiting for the the cable company to set it up when the TV came on the screen was broken. I called the store and they refused to honor the warranty and replace the TV.

My companion and I (always) order the vegetarian platter, which was $18. We asked the owner/manager if it's $18/person (a popular way Ethiopian restaurants seem to charge for their dishes) and he said it's meant to fill one person, but we may as well order 1 and see if we would be full. We were not. The platter is enough for 1.5 people(person?). The owner noticed we were not quite ""satisfied"" and when my friend asked if we could get another bowl of the sides, the owner gave it to us on the house. Now this is how you do business!! With the extra side, I had a very satisfactory and filling meal. So (you know what I'm going to say next), the service here was exceptional, including the waiter and waitress.

Food wise, the injera (which is gluten free) was very delicious in terms of flavour and texture. Also no upset stomach yay! The sides were not oily but was not as flavourful as I would have liked. Their best side in the veggie platter was probably their beets and this one side (that I cannot figure out what it is from the taste/appearance) that leaves a bitter after taste but is quite flavourful. The other sides were meh--again, not enough flavour.

Overall, food is a 3.5 (especially for the high price point), but the generosity of the owner and service from the wait staff moves them up to a 4.",3,v-R38AMN2ZZgr_iszlgc_Q

First, I discover this morning that Benkovitz Seafoods has gone out of business after over a century. 

After arriving home from work this evening, I called Krazy Brothers to order pizza and instead got Vinny's of Brookline!

According to the fellow who delivered the pizza and hoagie to our house, Krazy Brothers sold their phone number to Vinny's. So if you call the listed number from Krazy Brothers, you'll now get Vinny's. 

 Krazy Brothers was one of my 2 favorite pizza outlets in Brookline, the other being DeMino's, and it too is empty.

Arrived in the morning and paid $295 deductible for the planned 2-day stay in the hospital. I was told that Banner Estrella requires an overnight stay for this surgical procedure. After surgery and recovery I was assigned a room on orthopedic floor (6th floor). PT personnel came to my room and conducted an extensive therapy session.  I had dinner served to me in the assigned room that evening.  I told my surgeon that I felt really good and asked if he would discharge me.  He had the nurse make sure I had meds from the hospital pharmacy and I was discharged that evening.

Six months later I received a bill from Banner Estrella Med. Ctr. for $1,684. After numerous calls to my insurance company and Banner, I was told by Banner that the $1,684 charge was due to the procedure being classified by them as an ""outpatient procedure"".  A procedure, I might add that cost a total of $71,565.  Had I stayed overnight like I was scheduled, there would have been no charge - doesn't quite make sense - does it.  If it was going to cost be $1,684 to have my doctor discharge me early - shouldn't someone from the hospital have told me that. Given the option of paying $1,685 to go home that evening or stay overnight and pay nothing - I certainly would have stayed overnight.

After numerous attempts to get their billing people to review my situation I was told it was turned over to Patient Relations and that I would be contacted in a few days regarding the matter.

I asked to see a very specific hair I was interested in and was told that it wouldn't suit me even though I was previously shown that exact hair and it had fit my hair perfectly. She was rude and very unhelpful as for I walked away without a much needed purchase. This is the second time that her service has driven me out without help.,0,qBCqEWr3hwH2PzmIdBdGow

Within approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.

They say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. 

The strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!

Most of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. 

Kick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.

I did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.

I did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!

I decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. 

I ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!

At the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!

My nails look absolutely terrible . I should have just walked out when I saw the tech's hands, but for some reason I still sat down . First things first, she didn't remove my gel properly ... she had it soak for like 20 mins and it still didn't even budge . There was still spots of polish on it when she started, but I was getting virtually the same color so I let it slide . She didn't soak my hands to do a manicure and she didn't clean my nails properly before adding the gel . My manicure looks terrible and she didn't clean up the edges nails at all . The paint is uneven, has bubbles in it & is all over the place . I asked her to fix it multiple times and she said she would but never did . On my feet, she didn't give any type of massage at all . She just poured oil all over my legs and then wiped it off with a dry towel . The towel left lint on my toes, which she didn't clean with alcohol before she tried to put the gel on. The clear base layer was uneven, had bumps in it,  and there was towel lint on 2 of my toes (which I pulled out myself because she said she couldn't see it). I brought the rough base to her attention before I dried it and she ignored me multiple times even after I pulled my foot away to stop her and show her what I was talking about before I put my foot in the dryer . The colored polish looked extremely streaky and started to clump and bubble as she put the first layer on, because she didn't clean my nails with alcohol first before applying the gel, and she just kept trying to paint over it . She just kept saying ""it will even with next coat"" and I explained to her that it was the base coat and she ignored me . I was there for over 2 hours and I left completely livid . My tech was the only person who was there when I left so I couldn't even ask to have it fixed or re-done by someone else. To top it all off, I saw that she was taking the cotton balls out of the foil that she had used on my toes and SAVING THE FOIL !! That was completely disgusting and unsanitary and I was repulsed .

Pros: I think the environments of both the restaurants (downtown & Henderson) are beautiful and clean. The service has always been great at both locations. Also, Vegenation supports local businesses and stands for great things that align with my progressive values.
Cons: I just don't think the food is that good. I often eat Vegan & Vegetarian, but I have never been wowed by the food. 
The buffalo wings have been the only saving grace, the vegan burrito was pretty mushy and could have used another element that provided texture, the taco was overly sweet, and the biscuits and gravy were nearly inedible (biscuits were great, gravy was gross!).

I ordered home fries, two eggs over-medium, whole wheat toast and coffee. The only thing cooked to order was the home fries- but the ketchup they gave us was over a year expired. Yuck? My eggs were heavily salt and peppered and over-hard, my toast wasn't even toasted. It was just slightly warm bread. And our coffees were a sickly sweet hazelnut, which neither of us had asked for.

So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.

From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.

First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.

Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.

Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).

The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors

I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this ""as good as it gets""?  No.

I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive.",0,YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw

Service, that Hot n Juicy sauce [I'll be tasting and smelling of this for a couple of days], and even the decor are all the same.  They even send in the same pretty lady to all their stores to help gets things off the ground given by what she has said at their Tempe grand opening.

Anyways, I pretty much always order the same items:  Hot N Juicy crawfish, lemon pepper shrimp, a basket of their cajun fries, and their oysters.  Their oysters are always a gamble though since you can never tell when they're fresh until you actually bite into one.  After the past few hit-and-misses, I think I'll pass on their oysters from now on.  They are currently serving frozen crawfishes as it's not in season so I say hold off until summer if you can.  If not, they're still big and plump but nothing beats fresh crawfishes.

This is such a great and prime location for Hot n Juicy!  Now the west valley folk can get their fill of seafood and the Tempe location can be all mine... MINE!  Best of luck to HnJ!",26,zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw

My niece and I both had the three cheese stuffed burger.  Neither of us like cheeseburgers but having something between two layers of beef (or chicken) makes it taste very different.

We waited for about 15 mins to be seated.  Had a couple more minutes to wait for drinks.  

I ordered the goat cheese, tomato, spinach scramble (I think that's what it was...)  BF ordered smoked salmon scramble.  

They got to the table, portions are huge and presented nicely.  I started to eat the fruit  and was looking for pepper for my eggs when I realized there was ham in mine.  Hmmm.  Not what I ordered.  I ate the fruit and biscuit.  Both fine.  The potatoes were actually pretty good.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I liked them.  No waiter to check on us at this point.  I decide to at least try the egg mixture on my plate.  Kind of greasy.  Just okay.  Tried the BF's salmon eggs.  Same thing.  Just okay.  Though he did have the pleasant surprise of a bone in them :/

Finally waiter comes by asking how we are.  At this point, I am done eating.  I have eaten enough carbs between the potatoes and biscuit that I don't want anything else.  But I tell him everything is fine, except what I got was not what I ordered.  He looks, ""oh, you are right"".  Yeah, I know that.  ""Do you want me to go switch it?"".  Um, no.  I have been here 15 mins and have already filled up on other stuff.  ""You sure?""  Yes.  ""Was what you did get served good at least?""  Seriously?  Um.  It was okay.  ""I am sorry about that"".  Yeah okay.

I will search far and wide (though, I'm not sure that's the actual expression) for a great burger. I've heard many a tale of the great Village Bar burger, that uses the power of steam to cook their burgers. But it is a mere dive bar, surely you don't mean that a cash only location such as this has mastered the art of frying a burger. Aye! I have tasted its divine glory! Now, a burger that can make me feel like I need to write in the style of a medieval knight on an epic quest must mean it's a good eat (I hate the medieval theme so much - it just happened, I'm sorry).

Back to the burger. I don't know quite how to describe the 'moistness' of the actual patty - it wasn't that it was 'juicy' because often juicy means messy. No, this was something else, burgers can easily get dry if you cook it too long, this patty was far from that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Top it with cheese and place the pickles on the side (thank you - didn't realize I needed to ask without pickles, glad to see they weren't served on my burger) and I think I just enjoyed what everyone has been raving about.

The Village Bar - you a quite a vintage little place aren't you? I'm not particularly fond of dive bars, but they had so much classic memorabilia displayed in the table that made for a nice little search and discover during my wait for food. They also have plenty of tvs (even some flat screens) to watch the game of your choosing. I must say, I was annoyed that they don't take cards, though I'm sure my review won't be changing that anytime soon - at least they have an ATM accessible inside the bar.

There is just something about that burger that will have me stopping in again and bringing friends as they stop in town for a visit. For that reason, and that reason alone - The Village Bar has earned all five of my stars that I have to give.",3,1Dj1VmFzA-t9fT8d4ExJAA

The first time I ate here last year, I tried a burger off the menu.  The beef was very tasty and the quality and freshness was undeniable.  Would I have made a burger like this at my place?  No.

The second time I ate here, which was last week, I requested a ""regular"" burger which wasn't on the menu because I wasn't feeling like having savory and sweet, and they obliged.  Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The food does take awhile to come out, especially if you're in a large party, so don't expect anything ""express"" style.

WHO in their WRONG MIND decided that it was good idea to close the Las Vegas strip for over 6 hours this past Sunday, December 4, 2011?  The rodeo finals were in town, the cowboy christmas, the michael jackson cirque immortal tour was openning, there was a big fight and so on and so on....the city was packed! 
Your city will be really lucky if nobody missed their shows, dinner reservations and flights out on Sunday afternoon.  It took us 2 hours by tram and monorail to get to the Mandalay Bay.  With a lot of walking too....in HIGH HEELS as I thought we were taking a Cab.  But, alas the cabs never left the driveway.  Persons heading to the airport were told it would take upwards of 3 hours to get to the airport.  I imagine a lot of people were missing flights.  People were walking in the middle of the marathon and blocking the races.  The marathon ended at the back entrance to the Mandalay Bay at the same exact time that the Michael Jackson show let out.  Thankfully chaos did not insue, because we would have been lucky to live though that.  The place was crowded to the point that children who are claustrophic were crying near us.  And, I don't know about the racers.  I imagine they were pretty tired.  Hope nobody collapsed becauser THERE WAS NO WAY IN or OUT.  We were stuck.  It took almost an hour to get out of the Mandalay Bay hotel.  There is no reason for this to have happened.

First time on this trail today, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. ( I put on a tough face and didn't whine.)

I am not super athletic like my MIL, who does marathons (st. george this weekend), and my guy, who does TRI events and what not.

We parked off of Horizon, and were alone, except for this young couple in their white car, making out and getting ""it"" on..They either didn't see my SUV pull up (which I doubt), or they didn't care.......Awkward.

Other than that, we did not see anyone else on the trail the two hours that we were out there. The ""switchbacks"" on it can be quite steep, and the gravel, sand and rock(s) are quite loose. You must be very careful with your footing.....and watching out for snakes, and wild life..... (duh)

Through the steepness, and elements of the walk, I sucked it up and made it through. I prefer Bootleg over this trail... but maybe I will get used to it.

The kids in the white car where gone when we returned.",2,bhmJrMRVc2sbk8XP00ravw

We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. 

The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited ""ooo""s and ""aahhh""s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.

The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.

Finally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.",6,365BYsU7cZIYFUPtEtl9nQ

The cappuccinos are done well, small cups, not too much foam, etc., with excellent flavor. Their baked goods are very good, for the small selection they tend to have. They are a bit on the pricey side though, but maybe that's just Calgary. It can get very busy, very quickly and there isn't a lot of seating, especially when it's cold out. The space layout is a little wonky too, but it seems to be good for socializing.

It does have the best cappuccino that I have ever had. Perfect size and flavor, and the pastries are good. There's a reason it's so popular.

What blows me away about the place though, is how popular it is. What I mean is, where are all the people coming from?

It would help if they just listed this in the description of the item vs. you having to guess. We ended up getting Szechuan chicken and Chicken with mixed vegetables and hot garlic sauce. We ordered fried rice instead of white rice. This didn't meet the $25 minimum for delivery, so we got an order of wonton soup.

Recently just last week Sporting Life had their grand opening and that literalli put the life back onto this mall. The Hudsons Bay recently just got a major renovation too, its now more modern and carries all the lines the Yorkdale location does.

They've also inserted an H&M and Sephora in there as well. I'm pretty upset still that they closed the boathouse outlet.

The only downfall to this mall is the food court reeks balls. It has very limited seating. Now they have expanded and brought some higher end stores they HAVE to update the food court, this one just isn't going to cut it.

Both times I was so impressed with how good all the food was! They cook up some really unique flavors here with very quality ingredients. Servers are also very friendly, and they really go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. 

My thoughts on the food:

Truffled Potato Chips w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce: Ordered this appetizer since its the top highlight on Yelp, and was blown away by how delicious this was. The potato chips were thick cut, fresh, and pipping hot -- it paired perfectly with the creamy, tangy blue cheese sauce. I don't even like blue cheese but I'm in love with this dish! (5/5)  

Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers: Very tender cuts of steak, thoroughly seasoned and covered w/ their house steak sauce. The dish comes with 5 decently sized skewers, but is a bit on the expensive side at $18. (4/5) 

Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings: This dish definitely satisfied my chicken wing cravings! If you've ever tried Vietnamese chicken wings, these have a very familiar taste with the strong hints of garlic and chili. Each wing/leg was generously glazed and very flavorful! (5/5) 

Prosciutto Pizza: Also ordered this dish as it was one of the top highlights on Yelp! My friends really enjoyed this pizza, but I thought the goat cheese was a bit too strong (albeit, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese). Regardless, I still really liked this pizza because the prosciutto gave it a really rich, buttery flavor. (4/5)  

Italian Sausage Pizza: LOVED this pizza! The contrast in flavors from the creamy ricotta, the sweet roasted peppers, and the juicy Italian sausage was perfection!! I might be a bit biased though because I pretty much devour anything with ricotta lol, but also the crust on both pizzas were cooked perfectly -- very thin and crispy.  (5/5)   

Also wanted to mention that the complimentary french bread we got at dinner was amazingly good since it was freshly baked, hot out of the oven stuff! They also threw in some garlic/onion & rosemary infused bread sticks that were super buttery and moist. The french bread at 4 am was just so-so, but that's to be expected haha",3,qpJvFXThQKW3bxicP9KSXw

She was even trying to hold my items for me while I looked. There was one product that we couldn't find so she checked the computer system to see if it was available or not. She was so sweet!

The menu changes depending on what Jackie (and yes, it's actually Jackie who makes the food) has cooked up for the day.  There are usually red, green, and yellow curries, but the meat and veggie combinations are switched up all the time. It's wonderful - every visit feels like a new experience! 

They always have creamy delicious options that would be friendly towards most peoples' taste buds, but if you are in the mood for something a little spicier, be warned, they are not afraid to turn up the heat!

We went to the Macy's Furniture store and found a couch and 2 chairs that we loved and they were having a great sale on. We ordered the pieces on 10/10/16 and were told they were special orders and that they would be made and delivered the week before Thanksgiving. My wife called the week before to see if there was something we needed to do to set up delivery arrangements. We were told that our order had been CANCELLED!! No one called us to let us know and they surely didn't refund our $700 deposit. After discussing with the salesperson, they apologized, adjusted the price and told us we would have it in 2 weeks as a rush order. Again, my wife has to call them to check on the status of the delivery and finds out that the order now has been set for FEBRUARY. Again, no call from Macy's to let us know, we had to call them. We speak with the manager and he says some furniture companies shut down for the holidays and that may be why the delay. We tell them that waiting that long isn't an option for us and he tells us he understands and will cancel the order and fully refund our deposit. We are told on 12/6/16 that it will take up to a week to get our deposit back. Again, no deposit refund and my wife has to call to check. Then we are told it can take up to 3 weeks for the refund! Well, here we are, 12/29/16, past 3 weeks, and still no refund. Guess my wife is going to have to call them AGAIN to follow up. 

Very disappointing process overall, even if the price is right, would not recommend purchasing from Macy's.",0,AsYwZ6a8r8tZd6xHuaHCmQ

The menu offers street food from all over the globe (yes it took me 2 trips here to figure out what the streets theme was referring to.) You can go with either small plates or sandwiches, which r huge and come with fries. This time my husband and I split the bolinho, the chorizo tapioca, and the pork and broccoli rabe sandwich. The bolinho were little fried dough balls stuffed with black beans, pork and veggies and spices. I thought they had a great flavor - very smoky. The tapioca is a lot like a quesadilla but made with tapioca instead of tortilla. Also very good with the chorizo.    Finally the sandwich was pretty fabulous, the pork was super tender and very well seasoned. It was also H U G E and the fries were delicious - they come with fresh herbs and cheese.

I went with a co-worker for lunch. I Love the colors inside the place.
Vey bright!!
I got the taco/enchilada lunch plate.
It was very tasty, and honestly pretty on-par with what you would expect from a Mexican joint for lunch.
The one thing that I DO like very much is the roasted corn that they put in their rice. YUMMMM!  That's is a big time win in my opinion.

I have been to one other Plaza Bonita; in Cottonwood.
I ordered the Pollo Mole.  
AMAZING! 
I wish there was a better way to present it, as it looked like Chinese style stir-fry chicken, on a plate of chocolate soup. LOL
BUT, after I ate all the chicken, I asked for extra tortillas( which were kindly retrieved), and I sopped up the remaining mole sauce( which is sweet, with a hint of peanut butter)

When I was a student, the proximity to campus was fantastic.  And I don't know if it still exists, but there used to be sneaky-ninja parking behind the restaurant where I parked my car regularly and was never towed.  I am sure I went at least an entire semester without paying for on-campus parking because of this sneaky-ninja space.  

Also when I was a student, the affordability of this place and the fillingness (I'm not sure if that's a word but you get my meaning) of the meal was super appreciated.  

I can honestly say that I do not have any recollection of having bad service here, whether drive-through or dine-in, and again, that's going on many (many) years of coming here. 

The food always tastes fresh.  While the actual menu items are limited, the 'styles' are varied.  Check out the not-so-secret menu (per your favorite internet search engine) and you'll know what I mean.  

Me, I'm a tradionalist.  Double-double with grilled onions, light on the sauce, with fries and a Dr Pepper easy ice.  When I'm looking for a tasty burger-and-fries, I will default to this tried-and-true In-N-Out burger.",0,x2KHPyEmsg0VL3B40-xfDQ

I walked in and was quickly greeted by Ed, sat down and showed him a picture of a lob as I wanted to even out my angled bob from December and needed to get rid of split ends. He gave me his opinion of the cut and told me it's an awkward length and will result in my ends flipping out for a while but will grow out nicely and settle down. I appreciated this as some stylists don't tell you anything and let you get a bad haircut!

I think...I'm pretty sure that I fell asleep sitting up during my hair cut, it was a pleasant experience and he spent a lot of time perfecting my lob making sure all the ends were even and perfectly styled. At the end he showed me my perfect lob in the mirror and said again it's an awkward length again assuring me it will grow out and look better, I told him I think the length is fine and I love it anyways! Ed is very polite and professional and I am already planning to come back to try a colour service:)

_FKn9oxlNDBl-lswKZt1Gw,2,2015-03-06 21:01:15,2,KMJG3Puj_WUmGbaZzq8unw,"Good afternoon,

I was viewing online prices and ran across this dealership. I looked at a Suzuki Boulevard C90 and was interested. Their price was 8000.00+. I went to Kelley Blue Book to verify the price. KBB price for exceptional condition with bags; 4000.00+. I asked the online support why the price difference? I understand markup and making profit.... This though was gouging.

She referred me to the Internet Manager. The INTERNET MANAGER stated she didn't know about my internet search but hers showed a price of 11,000.....

An INTERNET MANAGER for a retail car/motorcycle dealership that doesn't know Kelley Blue Book???? WARNING, WARNING, WARNING. At this point I had decided to not deal with them as they are either lacking competence or looking for people not to do their research. I was going to leave it at that. 

Then the General Manager sent an email asking if my questions had been answered. Here is my response.

Eric,

I did receive an email from your internet manager. It was professional but completely lacking merit or an answer to the question posed.

Here was the question: Why does the 2009 Suzuki C90 that you have on the website cost 4000.00 over the Kelley Blue Book valuation?

Your internet manager apparently doesn't know about KBB as she stated ""I can't speak for your search, but when I looked online for a reference on pricing independently from ours,""

Even using the guide that she stated ""NADA"" with the option of saddle bags it comes to a high retail price of 11299 with an average of 8368 and a low of 6388.

Your manager states deep discounts. There are none even based on the guide she's using, your selling at the average and passing it on as the deep discount based off of the high side. All this while not even taking into account one of the respected pricing models for cars/trucks/ and motorcycles.

Sorry but your dealerships lack of knowledge of one of the most respected and well known pricing guides by your internet manager, trying to pass off deep discounts while selling at the average price (even from your own price guide) and previous poor ratings (as they seem to be inline with this conversation) have made me realize your not the dealership I want to do business with.

Respectfully,


BEWARE!! BEWARE!! BEWARE!!",7,svNJoagdDpI80eNGKKzxnQ

I hired Inks Installation to do a roof job July 28, 2015.  I found multiple problems with the installation.  The roof valley lines were cut uneven and the alignment of singles were off.  What I found the worst is nail heads exposed on a shingle that has a two inch strip showing where to nail.  Something this simple makes me wonder on how the whole installation was done. 

I thought the owner, Mike Inks, would like to know the quality of work his men were doing so I called and had to leave a message.  In the next two weeks I called everyday leaving messages with his office. Now the office must have my number because I cannot get anyone to pickup the phone.  What a piece of work this company is. To top things off I checked this company out before hiring them.  I found they were recommended by  Owens Corning, the shingle manufacturer, have a OK rating with BBB and are on Angie's List.  How does that happen?

   I am now left with a roof with exposed nail heads and a warranty from this company that is totally useless.  Think anyone else when looking for a roofer!",0,jdCoOzYipC5In8_1-RI0lg

As I was not happy with my massage I only left $10 which, in my opinion, is already a hefty tip for something I didn't enjoy. Then i was already leaving and the receptionists stops us and lectures us why we should tip more. That was extremely EMBARRASSING as the lobby was full of people staring at us. I gave an extra $5 and the therapist grunted and snatched it away from me (without exaggeration). They were nice in the beginning but show their RUDE side if you don't tip 40% or more. They even have huge lighted signs around the building telling you how much they should be tipped. I thought that was a little too much. 

I went in for the full body massage. It started okay then ended really rough. Walking on backs is not a new massage technique but this was not done well at all. This was not the first time I had this done on me either. It was too rough, too much pressure, and extremely uncomfortable. I did let the massage therapist know that it was hurting but he only stepped slower. I notified them a SECOND time and there was no change at all.

We had a car transferred from the South Blvd. location. Our salesman, Keith, was very knowledgeable and helpful. Unfortunately, the description of the car online said that the car had a few features (moonroof) that we realized the car did NOT have when we went for the test drive. Still, we were happy enough with the car to purchase it. When we sat to sign the papers, I was only handed one key. Our salesman said he would call the original location to find out if there was a second key. When I went back the next day to pick up the car, he told me that there was not a second key. When I asked him how I could get a second key, he called another man over, who explained that their dealership could not cut a second key because the car was originally from a sister dealership. Then he continued to explain that if they'd given me another key, that would put them in competition with the sister dealership. If these dealerships are sharing cars, then how can they be in competition with one another? Finally, he said in order to get a second key from them, I should have demanded that a second key be given to me before the sale was completed. I should have made it a ""make it or break it"" thing with the key. I felt like that statement was unprofessional. Even after all of that, the key they actually gave me has a battery that is dying. (I've had the car for less than a week.) If a customer is spending almost 20k on a car, the least the dealership can do is give the customer two keys. This is petty. Now, I have to spend several more hundred dollars to have a new key made.

**updated** The general sales manager, Bob Jones, called me directly and helped me get a second key, free of charge. So, I bumped the rating up from two to four stars. He didn't have to go out of his way, but I'm glad he did!",3,zHWtRcAXS8r8Ckf3qxAAqw

My sister had warned me it would be $54pp. The site doesn't say and it's been awhile now so I don't recall specifics, but it was around there.

The food was alright. In the pictures on the site, it looked much more grand, like an endless display of scrumptious entrées and desserts. The reality consisted of two sections: one for diy omelette, pancakes/french toast & toppings, roast beef, salmon wellington, sausage/bacon/etc; another smaller one for wraps, salads, desserts. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad. It's just that there was so much expectation coming in that I was surprised i wasn't blown away. (At least it wasn't like at Maman where I took one look and walked right out!)

The service and decor, now that's what makes up this place. The café is located under a condo but when you walk in, it's as if you're transported to Paris. (Or how we romanticize it in our heads.) The decor is absolutely beautiful and the ambience alone makes it worth visiting again. The service is impeccable.

Now, I DIDN'T order a pizza...I know right. If my gluten intolerance would give me a break that would be very different. Considering it is a pizzeria, I had to hope for the best in the case of my dinner. Usually these fancy extensive butter using European based places will fill you up with just a salad. I got some big green salad which turned out to be rather literal with the word big. So good too. By the end I was ready to break. After that we got fries and  ""crispy"" green beans. Yep, both really great. The fries are a little different just warnin yuh. The green beans really hit the spot and gave me something to take home. 

Everyone around me got pizza and I don't remember anyone saying it was anything special. The woman beside me ordered ribs. And oh.my.god. number 1: they took longer then the rest of the orders; number 2: the dead thing was HUGE and on a cutting bored. She could barley slice it.

The service was pretty good and the whole feel of the place was great. It's small though. One big table for a big party and the rest are pretty much date tables. It's a warm atmosphere and all that and the wine list was pretty good as far as I could tell.

lO5sV5_wbUq31jlZkGAyXQ,7,2011-02-01 03:23:21,6,WH0gcZcybstxzr0APZ42Bw,"Went to my first of many Winterlicious adventures today.  The line-up includes: Trevor Kitchen & Bar, Biff's Bistro, Midi Bistro and today's all-star dinner at Reds Bistro & Wine Bar. 

Winterlicious has been a tradition of mine, like Christmas, lol since 4 years ago.  I have had my fair share of good and bad experiences.  Reds Bistro has reminded me that Winterlicious can be a positive experience, net of any condescending treatment that we're paying a cheaper price to experience fine dining.

I arrived early, and was seated promptly by the hostess.  It wasn't before long before my Andrea arrived.  Since I had already read through the menu prior to arriving I knew exactly what I wanted.

I ordered the Foie Gras & Chicken Liver Parfait to start, the Roasted Venison Chop as a main, an the Chocolate & Raspberry Panna Cotta to finish off the evening.

When the bread basket came I was excited that they were serving warm bread!  I hate nothing more than being served cold bread at a restaurant.  It's almost like they're saying ""We know we could serve it warm, but it's too much effort to pop it in the oven.""  There were two kinds, sesame and white bread.  The sesame bread was too chewy.  I felt like I was going to get lock jaw just trying to eat it.  The white bread was great, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside... Ah...

The Foie Gras & Chicken Liver Parfait was an explosion of flavors.  It was served pâté-style with a cognac gelée and a berry compote.  It was very velvety smooth, and the cognac gelée was very tasty! The crackers that accompanied the dish were very light and crisp, nicely buttered with just the right amount of crunch.  The combination was ingenious!  Andie had the Butternut Squash & Sweet Potato soup with Duck Rilette.  I didn't taste much of the duck, but the sweetness of the sweet potato with the smoothness of the butternut squash were irresistible!

Our entrees were very savory as well.  The roast venison chop was done medium-rare, perfectly seared on the outside, and just pink on the inside.  This is how I prefer most steaks or game meats done because I find anything more well done than that comes out tough and too chewy. The venison was very tender and the fleur de sel that topped it off added a certain je ne sais quoi.  It was served on a bed of apple and sauerkraut and roast potatoes.  The roast potatoes were yummy!

The dessert was a little disappointing.  I expected a panna cotta, you know, the custard-like-jiggly-creamy dessert that you've had at Italian restaurants before?  I don't know what I was served, but it was definitely not a panna cotta.  It was not quite soft or airy enough to be deemed a mousse... It was more like a hybrid between a ganache and a mousse.  I would say that the dessert was the most disappointing part of the evening, but the appetizer and main were so good that in the grand scheme of things, it didn't matter all that much.  I think that Reds Bistro is one of the better restaurants to go to for Winterlicious, as the food was fairly portioned, and extremely appetizing!  I will definitely come back again.

NB. For entertainment purposes only - We sat at a booth behind a table of cougars, very Sex and the City minus the glam and youth, lol.  They were all totally doting on the server who was IMHO pretty cute.  Think, Samantha when she was at RAW and met Smith Jerrod, it was one of THOSE moments.",11,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg

Did learn a lesson - if you order drinks, wait till they arrive before you order your food. We ordered cocktails and they did not show up until we were 2/3 done with our dinner, not the time I usually enjoy a cocktail. Cocktails were delicious, but still the flow of service wasn't really in place. However, our waitress was nice and accommodating and the manager came over, they comped a piece of their yummy banana cream pie. So definitely going back just now know wait for drinks, then food.",1,_VaCHA9gfPvcPQFJribOyw

I ordered the margherita pizza and my husband ordered the baked lasagna - both exceeded our already high expectations!!  It's hard to live up to the authentic characteristics of a true Italian margherita pizza and this place did it.  The crust was crispy yet fluffy fresh in the middle, thin bottom, sweet and fresh roma tomatoes, ample amount of fresh mozzarella, topped with fresh and large pieces of basil.  I want more!!

The lasagna from initial reaction was rather small in size when presented in the bakeware.  Once you dive in, it was power packed with flavors from the meat, cheese, flat lasagna noodles and sauce.  Unbelievable taste.  Served with a small arugula salad.  

For dessert we had the zeppoli - my God, this was amazing.  The chocolate drizzle that you dip the donuts in was mouthwatering.

I also ordered a red sangria - perfection.

Everything about this visit was flawless.  We will definitely be back again.  The atmosphere is fancy but not too showy or intimidating.  The views are just as good as The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

This is a really small store, with barely enough room to stand if there's half a dozen people waiting for their orders or hanging around to chat or other activities after receiving their drink. Fortunately, the sidewalk along Yonge is huge and they have a couple tables and seats set up outside. However, I can't imagine what things will be like once the cold weather rolls around.

The person taking the order did not seem to have a very efficient process figured out, which included taking the orders, sticking the order onto the cups, handling payment, and scanning the rewards app. Sometimes the people making the drinks would mess up, and then he has to do damage control, which means the order process is delayed even further. This likely contributes to the long wait times from the moment you line up, to the moment you receive your receipt.

Scanning the rewards app was also particularly complicated, as he takes the phone to scan with the tablet and then returns it to you. The first time he did this, the rewards didn't go through, which led to me interrupting the order line so that I can get the points added to my account successfully. I don't know if they can check whether it went through or not but it's pretty sloppy.

I ordered the alley trio milk tea, as I had enjoyed it at a different location previously. A large cup is $6, but it includes 3 toppings, one of which tastes quite fruity. The drink itself felt and tasted quite watered down compared to the one I had before which had a richer consistency (more milk perhaps). Toppings were alright, but I'm expecting a much more satisfying drink at this price-point.

I'd rather just go across the street to Palgong and order a classic milk tea for $2.99 which comes with tapioca and a more comfortable seating experience.",3,CQ67NJigSe5-uBDX3b_CUw

My wife and I have been here once before years ago but in the mood for diner food so we decided to give it another try. Last time as I remember was very good.

This time turned out to be a mixed bag, Some items were beyond the control and the restaurant, the other part well within their control.

It's a popular restaurant and they share a parking lot in a small strip mall with other stores so parking is woefully inadequate. Say people not only double parking but in some cases, triple parking. Ended up dropping my wife off to get in line while I parked next door in the Darby Acres  Shopping Center Parking lot and walking over.

When I walked in, my wife told me there was a 20 minute wait which was OK.  Seating for those waiting for a table or a take out order is limited so be prepared to wait.

The 20 minutes turned out to be pretty close to actual and frankly I was expecting longer. We were seated at a small table on the other side of the divider from the counter which was OK.  Small but still was able to put my crutches in a place where they were out of the way and did not impede other diners.

Server was there shortly with menus and to take our beverage orders. My wife ordered just water and I went with  1/2 and 1/2 Sweeten Tea which was still too sweet. Hate to thing what regular sweet tea taste like.

We had looked over the menu on line before we came so we pretty much knew what we were going to order.

My wife order the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which is one of her favorites. Came with Fries but for $.50 more you had the option of upgrading up to Onion Rings which she did.

I ordered the Roast Tom Turkey over Dressing which came with a Salad and a Side. Tried to order a Baked Potato but that was not one of the listed sides so went with Potato Salad along with the Salad which I got with an Italian Dressing.

The Salad came out shortly along with Bread which was pretty good. The Salad was good also but unfortunately I had to look at the aftermath through out the rest of my meal as demonstrated by the attached photos.

After I was finished and when my main course was served, I asked if she would remove the dirty dishes and all I got was "" in a minute"".  Asked again another time but in the end, I ended up looking at these dishes throughout our stay.

Entrees in or themselves were good and portion were huge. My wife loved her Philly Cheese Steak and Onion Rings and because the portions were so large, ended up taking some home.

My Tom Turkey was also good and ended up taking some home as well. Problem was the Mustard Salad which was suppose to be Potato Salad. Could not taste anything beyond the mustard and my lips were still burning 30 minutes after I left the restaurant. 

Mustard is suppose to be a subtle addition to Potato Salad and suppose to accent the dish. It's another thing to overwhelm the dish to the point that that is all you can taste and 30 minutes later, your lips are still burning.

Final problem as on check out and I did not catch this but my wife did. The $.50 upgrade to Onion Rings had become $.75. Not a big thing but became a big thing for my wife after watching dirty dishes for 20 minutes while we ate lunch.

Parking is beyond their control. Seating is within their control and they did a good job. The service including the implicit refusal to remove dirty dishes, inaccurate billing and inedible side dishes are well  within the control of the restaurant.

Some good points at the restaurant and a number of less than desirable so let's just put it this way, I've experience better and in may cases, a lot better.",37,GGTF7hnQi6D5W77_qiKlqg

Service:  Waitresses were sweet and friendly but food came out slow. The last sushi plate we ordered didn't even come with ginger or wasabi.

Food:  Ordered the all you can eat from the larger menu.  Initially we had decided on ordering from the 70 item menu but the sushi selection is SERIOUSLY lacking.  They offer only a few vegetarian type maki rolls and the typical kitchen stuff.

Okay, so the rice was extremely bland.  The meats/ combination was mediocre.  All in all, sushi was a little below average.  We never got everything we ordered either ... had to order the spider roll THREE times before we finally got it ... I think the chef selectively leaves off the more expensive rolls hoping that the diner will forget.  We overheard other guests complaining about the same thing.  

Ordered the agadashi tofu and it was not bad except there was a bleach taste - ugh :(  Ordered some other tofu appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting - it was cold and had these bark like paper things on it.  I have tried a similar type of tofu dish at other restaurants and it was much better.

I will first off say that the service we had was great! From putting tables together to accommodate our group to being friendly and smiling throughout the night, I can't complain about the service.  So why only 2 Stars?

Well the food was allllllll-right.  Probably ate it b/c I was more hungry than anything else.  I ordered the smoked duck fettuccine.  The smoked duck actually was the best part - first off there were pretty decent amount of duck in here which had a nice smoked/salty taste.  It's the pasta that was a let down.  I think it needed another minute or so in boiling water b/c it was too al dente for me.  The nice cream sauce started to 'harden' as I was eating my meal instead of being rich and creamy it just kinda globbed into the pasta.  Essentially I just picked out the duck and ate that.  The portion is a bit small for the price (perfect for me but I think most people would find it slightly smaller sized than other places)

On Baldwin St I expect you to bring your game!  There are much better Italian places in the city.",1,Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA

An important thing to note is that even if you are brand new they will treat you like a regular ( or at least very nicely and with a personable touch)

I've had a lot of the food there and I can guarantee its all delicious. From the deep fried pickles (yes!) to the Italian dishes this place does EVERYTHING well. Pub fare as well as not-pub fare always satisfies. Their french fries are probably the best I've had in Toronto.

Drinks are nice, but not out of this world, good beer selection and pretty good cocktails.

although the buspersons are a little boring and uninterested, the waiters, owners, bartenders (all the same people) and chefs are all great fun to have about. A good crowd of assorted people come here (young/old/gay/straight/drunks/lightweights/dirty/clean) so you'll fit in no matter who you are. you'll want Martin to be the waiter, he is the really gay and really awesome one. You'll see what I mean, he will make you want to keep coming back.

A small grievance is that the place is fairly small, especially in the winter when their great heated patio is out of commission (I guess its not that heated), I consistently find myself walking in with a date and finding that there is only ONE table for two available in the whole bar, convenient but I like to play it safe.

I had brunch here once and it was great, although I'm more of a $5 breakfast guy.

I find it really funny that the elites are mad at this place because when they break a rule, the waiter gets annoyed with them (what else could happen?)",9,tG3_ON9C8rscxux5wxez9Q

I've stayed at the Hotel here before and it was 2.5 or 3 stars at best. The property is now owned by the same owners as the 4 Queens where I love to stay which is where I just stayed for 3 nights. Binions hotel portion has been closed for over a year for renovation, but the casino has remained opened. They have Zero Rake at their $2/4 Limit Hold'em poker tables 9am to noon. Not sure if that includes weekends. I wanted to play at Binions just cause it's sorta a tradition for me... playing where all the legends of poker used to play. I've had the pleasure to meet many of them... Doyle, Hellmuth, Ferguson, Chan and more... 

So on my last day of my Vegas trip, sat down at the $2/4 Limit cash game (the only game going at the time) and after a few minutes of play, I win a pot with quad fives... JACKPOT! Yup... I won over $1,500 for the high hand jackpot... Luv you more Binions!

No smoking allowed in the poker room. Free drinks while playing poker. A decent mix of regulars and tourists provide a lively game.

The hotel is being renovated so it should open sometime in 2013... In the meantime, if you like to find a low limit cash game or a $1/2 NL Texas Hold'em cash game... this is not a bad place to spend your time.

If you are looking to party, spend a lot of bucks on bottle service, VIP treatment and party with the beautiful people... look elsewhere... but if you are looking for an inexpensive casino to play some poker... I highly recommend you go to Binions at least once. 

I like to stay at the 4 Queens and play poker here at Binions and at the Golden Nugget if you want to know. They are all within a block of each other, as opposed to staying on the strip where it is a loooong walk just going to a casino next door to the one you are leaving...",3,KMfLcj021gd55naYESzSkA

Although the service wasn't exactly the smartest cause we were trying to share some appetizers but waiter dropped it off w/ no plates and one utensil. -_- 

With that said, I thought the  curry was great. I got level 5 and I thought it was great. It was spicier than I thought it would be but I also tried a lvl 9 and it tasted the same for odd reason so I say just get the lvl 5...save the extra cents. The pork katsu was really good. I usually get scared when they put a lot of fat into my pork(where they basically rip you off cause it's so much fat) but that didn't happen. Croquette was okay too. Really, the spotlight was the curry + pork katsu cause it really tasted great.

I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

Eat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern).",1,8xLnR9z_Vk8RXl1uh5fT1A

Cons: very rude barista, bad coffee and food overpriced

This was my first time at Lucky's and I won't be returning. Upon arriving we decided to have a couple coffees while we waited for our table, this is the rude conversation I had with the female blonde elderly barista:

""What's a papa mocha?"" I asked
""It's the same as a mama mocha but with more fat"" she annoyed-ly answered 
""Ok, then what's mama mocha?"" I asked further
""Are you asking me what's a mocha?! It's cooofffeeee.....chooooccooolaaaate...."" She responded like I'm an idiot. 
""I know what a traditional mocha is"" I said
""I'm asking you if there's something that makes a Mama mocha different than a regular mocha"" I asked again. 
""It's a papa mocha with less fat"". She responded to my shock
""I'll have a medium coffee please. "" I surrendered. 
    She continued being rude, this time about me giving her my name instead of cash to pay for the coffee.  This was my first time. How was I supposed to know that she started a tab for me!? I was just trying to pay for my coffees.

Then we sat and ate. Host was nice. Coffee was terrible. Like that vacuum packed brick of coffee you buy from the corner store when you're really broke, bad. So on our out way out we complained to the rude barista about the coffee:

""I just wanted to tell you I really didn't care for the coffee."" I said
""Well that's the first complaint I've ever had about the coffee in 18 years"" she said
""Well, still, it's really quite awful, sorry. Do you know the brand of coffee you use or where the beans come from?"" I asked
She didn't answer me because she had no idea. Another barista said Caruso's in Brecksville. She made sure to tell me they roast it there.
   Anyone who knows anything about coffee knows that it doesn't matter Where it's roasted. And any barista worth half a cent, who cares even the slightest about coffee knows where the coffee is from. For the record Caruso's coffee is a business that buys the lowest grade coffee they can and they  roast it on site so that even though you're serving coffee that tastes like tar, you can shout from your rooftop, ""It's Locally roasted!""",8,GUfZeBpNf6Khl-EMasnuZQ

It was our second time back and we loved it equally as much as the first time. We went on weeknights both times and there was live jazz music. Awesome band both times--great singers, but the volume was a bit loud to hold conversations over. My boyfriend and I were shoulders-to-shoulders both times and we could just manage to hear one another. So I would recommend calling to check before having a large group dinner.

We had the fried calamari (with shrimp) appetizer and we loved it! Portion was generous and we were both stuffed before entrees arrived. They always serve raspberry sorbet on this decadent flower bowl to cleanse your palate before your main dish arrives--yum! (Almost feels like cheating to have dessert before dinner!)

Main courses were fried chicken waffle and lobster tail. I didn't try the chicken waffle because my boyfriend cleaned his plate before I could. The lobster tail was so flavorful with the risotto! We had ice cream for dessert (up to 3 flavors) but it took a while for it to come out.

The food isn't so good that it is worth it. The cashier taking your order was very angry and aggressive about people having their id.

Then she got my order wrong (she charged me for something that was $10 instead of $1.50) which I didn't notice until after my mother had already swiped her credit card. There was this huge ordeal about having to get the manager. The whole time she was extremely rude even though she had been the one to make the mistake and was wasting our time. 


I thought I would give this place a try since there is a long line here, which I foolishly assumed meant the food was good. I think the long line is just because a lot of people get breakfast vouchers here. We got a fruit tart, which was priced at $5.50 and seemed reasonable for Vegas and the location. I also got some rolls that were super cheap at 3 for $1.50. The food was unremarkable but definitely acceptable.

With a heavy heart I must write that I will no longer be a Patron of Bowl of Pho. As a regular customer since it's opening, I have found it to be a suitable, close to home replacement for Superior Pho Downtown.  Recently, the restaurant has been sold and is now not even a cheap Facsimile of the Former.   Over my last four visits out of dozens, yes I gave it four last chances, the protein portions in their Pho has become quite miniscule.  On my second last visit I asked the girl working the front counter if the place had been sold.  She replied yes, and said she was the new owner and why I asked.  I told that it seemed like her portions have gotten quite small and she said there had been no changes.  I asked her if I can have more meat and she begrudgingly did so.  Today I visited, giving my close to home friend one more chance.  Low and behold, I got my bowl of Pho, and the same portions.  I actually took out the meat and took a picture. Four or five pieces of sliced meatball, four pieces of meat, and a tiny portion of tripe.  During my latest visit to Superior Pho downtown, I took a picture of their Pho, you be the judge.  I know another issue with my fellow Yelpers is the ridiculously small amount of Siracha they provide. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. Today the owner was out and the manager on duty couldn't even open the cash register to give me change.  This man has been working there since day one, and can't even be trusted with the register.

The hotel is off the strip, but only by a 5 minutes drive. It's well worth it for the price.

In the casino they have a restaurant that has steak and eggs for $5 starting at midnight until 5am, I believe. It's decent and you cannot beat the price.

During the most recent trip we took, we checked in at 4am after the club and checked out at 9am. When we went to check out the lady decided to only charge us the resort fee since she said we only stayed there for 5 hours and we technically only took a ""nap"" there.

Cute little spot on Charles Street between Bay and Yonge; walk too fast, and you might just miss it!

I came here for brunch at 10:30 on a Sunday expecting it to be packed to the gills, but luckily there were a few tables free. 

Although the service was a little slow, our server was sweet and friendly. I had the French Toast -- it's a large plate with 3 humongo slices, plus bacon. The French Toast was nicely eggy and custardy, but nothing earth shattering. The bacon could have been a little more crisp, but it was still delicious.

This was my first trip to Madison for work (Go Badgers) and I was told by my boss I could not pass up Mickies Dairy Bar. Lucky for me, I have the sleep cycle of a retired grandmother so I was up and ready to eat by 6:00am. I strolled across campus from my hotel and found a quaint restaurant where I wasn't the only person outside taking pictures of the facade of the building. Inside, I had a flashback to the 50s that I never lived in with the old menu price and decor. I sat at the bar and took far too long to order because I wanted to examine my options (aka check out other peoples food). I settled on one griddle cake and a side of bacon as I had a long day of walking ahead. The griddle cake was the size of a toddler bicycle wheel and came along with an apology for taking so long -- which it didn't take long at all. Soon after I arrived, ESPN followed me in to shoot a special on the ""tastes of the town"". I slowed the pace of my eating to be an innocent-background-fat-kid-eating-pancakes bystander (why didn't I order an omelet...) and made friends with the locals just chit chatting. Just the one griddle cake was too much to handle but I wish I could have eaten the strawberry rhubarb cobbler fresh out of the oven steaming with melted butter right in front of my nose. The manager was so nice to explain all of the foreign Wisconsin words and foods and told me about how nuts it got during the day.

Today, I decided to try something out of the ordinary and got a salmon skin roll. It was my first time ordering this, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but it was entirely inedible. I took one bite and threw out the rest. There were so many fish scales in the one piece of sushi, that it tasted completely disgusting. When I called to complain I was given a very insincere ""Oh, well thanks for letting us know. Bye."" No mention of, I'm sorry, would you like a refund, nothing. I've been a loyal customer for over a year now, and this is how they treat their customers.  

As is, I avoid going to eat at the restaurant because my one experience there is not a pleasant one. The ""waitress"" did not greet us when we came in, took 15 minutes to bring us a menu, and we had to chase her down for water because she was back in the kitchen for a lengthy amount of time when there were other tables beside ours looking bewildered. Our grilled calamari showed up cold, and tasted like rubber, and half of what we ordered never showed up, so when we questioned as to where it was she told us that they ""were out"".

These guys sent a technician out, he was nice enough and pretty quickly diagnosed my fridge issue, and was going to order the part.  Got a call from the infamous Debbie the next day saying that this part was under mfgr warranty and not covered under the home warranty.  We called GE to have a guy come out the next day, bummed on having to pay another $100 on top of the trade fee I'd already paid to ProTech.

I looked at my mfgr warranty, and it clearly stated what was covered, and the part that Debbie said was covered - was not.  So began my 2 hours of phone calls...

Finally, after 2 calls to GE and 3 calls to the home warranty company, I got the home warranty company and GE on the line together with me, and GE clearly stated that the part in question was not covered by their warranty.

Thinking I was done, I called Debbie back, left a message (I got the answering machine 3 times I called that day - they have caller ID apparently) - and she called me back and told me that SHE had talked to GE and they said that the part was covered.  Keep in mind that I had my warranty paperwork, and had also talked to two different people at GE warranty, and they were very clear to me and the (very nice) home warranty company rep that it was not.

I offered to call them together and ask so we could get it straightened out for once and for all, but she refused.  Very impolite and combative.  If I would have told her the earth was round, she would have told me it's flat.

Looking through all of the other folks that have had bad experiences with this company, I'm a little shocked that this leading home warranty company continues to send their customers to ProTech.

So we cancelled the GE service call (saving us $100 we didn't need to spend) and were re-assigned to another company.  And yep, checked them out on Yelp!!",5,NF4qRgj-560Ul-GyITBhUw

I found it totally mediocre.   Is it better than Olive Garden, absolutely.  Is it better than Carrabba's - not so sure.  I used those chain restaurants as a point of reference.    At prime time, expect a wait.   The place is small.  No bar, so you will have to sit in the reception area, which is also tiny, but there is only one bench, so just stand there.   Speaking of small area, this lends itself to a very loud dinner.  Just saying, if you are expecting an intimate ""date night"" dinner, forget it.

My dinner was the Chicken Marsala.  Not the greatest, not the worst.  Meh, just okay.   Very large portion is a bonus.   My wife went with Chicken Parm.  She liked it, but commented the sauce was average.  My son went with the Shrimp Alfredo, he loved it, but had to add salt and extra grated parm cheese.

PRESENTATION: Beautiful. 5/5

Another good thing is that their prices are laid out on their board when you enter.  Therefore, you know exactly what you're getting in to. This isn't the place where you can haggle for a discount.

For the entree I had the mango, black bean salad with chicken.  It had sweet juicy mango with white meat chicken, black beans, raspberries and served with a tasty lime dressing.

The first time we tried to have dinner at Superica, on a Saturday,the wait was more than an hour and we left. Cut to the following Tuesday, my coworker and I decided to pow wow after work and I suggested we try Superica again. We had back up plans prepared just in case. Turns out we were super lucky to be seated right away and we secured awesome parking easily, too! 

The atmosphere was very different than other places in Charlotte. We joked that there should have been tumbleweeds crossing on the video that was playing on the projector. The restaurant has great attention to detail from the complimentary matches to the beautiful bathrooms. 

We each ordered a drink and got down to business with the menu. The sangria was not very strong but I would recommend their house blended margarita. Sneaky, sneaky. One more and I would've been giggly all night. 

I love that we received chips and salsa to start. The chips were crisp and thin, both salsas were fresh and added flavor to our meal. The presentation of the salsas with descriptions of each was a nice surprise. Not just a filler item, no stale chips and jarred salsa here. We each ordered fajitas with queso fundido to start. It was an insane amount of food. You are definitely getting what you pay for and can choose to share an order of fajitas between two people. The mixed fajitas with shrimp would be my top choice for the shrimp alone! Each shrimp has a sliver of jalapeño tucked into the backside and then wrapped in bacon and I'm assuming deep fried. Ooh... just give me those skrimps! The queso is worth the hype and is great on its own but there are options for toppings. Both plates came with warm tortillas. The fajitas come with an array of toppings, rice and beans with cheese. Do not skip the beans. I ""don't like"" beans. Mm-hmm. Not anymore. Superica's refried beans are topped with cheese and popped under the salamander to become a melty, toasty, dip-able side. Friend, turns out I like refried beans. 

Make sure to check out my picture of my to go box. I'm not kidding when I say I had a ton of food. I went home with enough to eat another meal. We spent a pretty penny: $108 before tip for two with an app, 2 meals and 4 cocktails. And still I say I can't wait to come back!

Martini is much more expensive if they use grey goose vs. Absolut, but as we saw Greygoose we believed this was the vodka they would use for vodka based drinks, but in fact it would come with a price tag and the bar tender did not explain this difference.
Overall, food is very good but very  expensive.

Luckily, I had a Groupon to use for this purchase because I thought for a burger and fries (no drink) for $16.11 is pretty pricey. Not to mention it was difficult to find this place inside the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. Coming from Mandalay Bay we had to cross the Luxor and into the Excalibur and go down the escalator to get to Johnny Rockets. The nice part was we didn't have to walk outside in the hot weather to get there.

After placing our order I was surprised that I was given a transporder machine thingie that buzzes you when your order was ready. Really? I thought it was a fast food joint.  I had the BACON CHEDDAR SINGLE - Smoked bacon, double cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, white onion & special sauce. I must say that it was tasty and delicious but for $10.95, uh-uh! The fries is separate at $3.95. It had no taste. I had to add salt. 

There are lots and lots of places to eat in Las Vegas on the Strip alone so it is unlikely that we will be coming back in this location soon. The place was kept clean and staff was okay but must try other food places before coming back here...

Unfortunately it seems that the influx of business they've received through their Groupon deals has taken a serious toll on the service and quality of food. Our last visit went from bad to worse pretty quickly. 

To start out, we decided to sit on the patio, and weren't greeted for about 10 minutes. We ordered the Claypot Chile wings as an appetizer, and waited for over 30 minutes for them to arrive! In the past, the Claypot Chile wings were one of our favorite items on the menu, but this time they were bland (almost tasted like they were coated in oil) and not nearly as crispy as we had grown to expect. The server mentioned they changed the sauce, probably to save money.

For dinner I ordered the Caprese salad with a side of Mac & Cheese, and my husband ordered a Cheeseburger. As I started digging into my mac& cheese I noticed a funky texture in my mouth, and it turned out to be a large piece of paper!! It was so large that I can hardly believe this wasn't noticed before it left the kitchen. Besides being absolutely disgusted, what shocked me the most was that the server didn't even bat an eyelash, and a manager NEVER visited our table AT ALL to apologize for the issue. 

To top it off, in order to salvage the rest of our meal I asked for some balsamic glaze from my very skimpily dressed Caprese salad and my husband asked for some ketchup, and we never received either!

Nope, I tried it again after I was semi-full, and still at awe by it. Yum yum yum. Here are the things we ordered: 
-red sangria (yum and fruity, I was so peenk!!! Asian genes *_*)
-clams (fresh and have lots of flavor, w chunks oh goat cheese)
-Barcelona fries (ok, I like the firefly version better)
-sliders (very tasty, and it came w fries, if only I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the full order of fries. Was too much)

food: 4*
service: 5*

Salads are always great, and you can't beat the cookies. And the atmosphere is pretty solid for lunch meetings, dinner with someone, etc. Very casual, but not overly so.

One gripe I have about this location: service times always seem slower here. Like there's people trying to stay busy doing other things and not exactly expediting the process of moving customers through the line. There are definitely some great people working here, but for example, the other night I waited almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a half for a to go order.

Unfortunately you will not be immediately seated as this is a pretty popular spot and the wait can take up to 30 minutes to an hour and maybe even more. So I just grabbed a number and checked out the Flamingo mini zoo they had on their property. You could also gamble away your wait time before it's time to eat.

My group of friends got some pretty spicy Bloody Mary's which came with souvenir cups. For food, the Two Sage Fried Chicken Breasts looked amazing which came with waffles infused with bacon (yes you read that correctly), hot maple reduction, fried leeks and served with two eggs. Me being the corned beef hash kind of guy got their Corned Beef Hash which you could tell was not straight out of a can like diners do it. It was a pile of home fries on the bottom and fresh beef on top all held together with your choice of cheese. It was already better than all diner versions of corned beef hash.

By the end of all of this, there was just too much carbs on the plate to finish everything. So I'd recommend coming in on an empty stomach or ordering food to split between two or more. As other reviews pointed out, the portions are massive and a lot will go to waste.",4,Z6ingIFgJt7SxWZpmTUxgw

So I opened it up, and I guess what? I'm right! There's barely nothing! There was just a tiny little bit of rice, 3 pieces of some tiny chicken, and that's it! 
I am so disappointed!!! Both 2 burritos are the same, the other one is even worse! So we went back, my hubby still approached them kindly expressing our concern and inconvenience, I mean like hello if this thing happened to other people, they would get a very crunchy swearing and all the evil names already! We still chose to be kind. 
They made new burritos for us, I thought they're going to make it up for us, but I'm wrong. They just put a little more rice and some chicken. And gave us some cinnamon crackers as a consolation! Big deal!

One super annoying occurrence was when I was looking in one of the mirrors and the consultant walked in front of me, blocking my view, to help her next bride.

Absolutely no personality and when she did communicate with me, it was often negative and ""we don't have that.""

I didn't want to pay TOO much considering it wasn't going to be slept on everyday but I didn't want a crappy mattress for guests either! At the recommendation of a friend, I was directed to Tuft & Needle's full size mattress. The ordering process was a breeze and I received many emails updating me on order and delivery status. Upon arrival, it came in a large rectangular box. I was skeptical - there is a mattress in this thing?

Once unboxed, i unrolled the mattress, poked a hole into the plastic wrap, and let it slowly inflate. It was really neat watching it expand from a thin sheet to this ultra thick memory foam mattress! I haven't personally slept in the bed but I have had 3 different guests to date, including one who said she has a spinal disc problem. Each of them raved about how comfortable their sleep was! :) They were really pleased with the firmness level (all sleep on their backs). 

All in all: Great price. Great delivery. Great customer service. Great mattress!! Visit them now at www.tuftandneedle.com and if you want to test it out I believe they have a showroom in their downtown Phoenix HQ. Support local! ;)",14,OZ0swpflv2ApbTDnNZJFSQ

There are endless pupu's (you can totally make these a meal) and they're hot items too; not just cereals and breads! The place gives off a very modern vibe with lots of ""pod-like"" spaces, chairs, and couches. Free wireless and apparently there are showers and towels available to lounge guests!

I was happy to see a Pho place so close to school. The food is decent. The price was decent at the time. I have visited the place every month or so and observed that the prices started to rise. However, the quality of the food and customer service stay the same: the foods are just 'decent' and it may take a while to get the waiter/waitress's attention.

Originally from California, I think Pho from Angelina's is no where near the 'authentic' taste.

Other that that, on a warm summer's eve, with that awesome Pittsburgh skyline right beside the stage and the band playing, it's hard to find a better venue. 

This particular night, myself and YFOJ (yoga friend of Joe) saw Asia (with all four original members) and Yes (I believe this was the 418 version of this band, with a lead singer who was hired for his awesome imitation of Jon Anderson from a YouTube video). It was a great night, I was transported back to the eighties. Ahh, the eighties, me barely twenty years old, big haired women, lousy one hit wonders from British rock bands who had no business cracking the top ten. A flock of seagulls, take on me, super groups like Asia, GTR, and after a ten year layoff from making music, Boston finally put out their third CD.

Asia and Yes played for three solid hours, with Steve Howell wowing us with his awesome guitar work for both bands.",1,UsmTxWbobLsI6WR1Db0W7A

She said she'd give me a call once they had it and that either way they'd call me if they didn't have it so I can go to another store. She took my information down on Tuesday, it's now Saturday and I haven't heard from anyone. Really would like to not live off the samples forever and need to know if I should go to another store to get this foundation. What gives?
----
I gotta say I've been pretty disappointed by the level of customer service this location has and have agreed with one of the other reviews about not once being greeted. Normally I don't like being bothered when I'm shopping but when you're spending the money on high quality products, and there are so many here, you definitely want to make sure your getting the right one and being able to ask their expertise and even get acknowledged when you are in the store goes a long way.
I've been to this location 4 times and 3 out of the 4 times I spent about 20-30min walking around and not one person acknowledged me or asked if I needed help. I wasn't sure if I just didn't look the part for them to care about me enough as a customer, either way it wasn't a good feeling and unsure about what to get I left all 3 times without a purchase. 
I decided to give this location another shot, it's the most convenient and I was in desperate need of more foundation. Down to the last drop I wanted to try a different foundation that had great reviews but I needed to be matched. Walking in from the parking lot I was literally thinking how much time it would take until someone noticed me.
Things weren't looking good but I think people should keep in mind to that this is a small location, most Sephora's have handfuls of employees always moving around the store and a dedicated greeter at the front. This location probably only has about 2-3 employees that I've seen at any given time. 
About 5min in Emma saved the day and swooped by to ask me if I needed help. I let her know I wanted to get color matched, let her know my skin concerns and we were off to the races. During my mini consult I remembered what I liked about Sephora compared to most other beauty stores like Ulta. I feel like when you can get an employee then they are devoted to you during that time, they aren't running off to multitask other customers, they don't rush you in and out, they really hone in on what you want and need and want to make you look good. 
Emma did a fantastic job of nailing the color I needed for my skin, we shared beauty and cleansing routines. I just really felt like I could take my time and hers and she had no problem showing me how to use products. I ended up spending about $50 more than I thought I would on other products because I felt like I had that initial direction from her and then I could go through and try other things with confidence. I left the store feeling super happy with my purchases and excited to implement them into my daily routine. While they were out of the foundation I wanted she gave me a nice amount of the product as a sample to hold me over until they got some in. 
Kudos to Emma, I hope when I return that she is there to help, I felt like she really went above and beyond to help me out and having that 1 on 1 time with the employees at Sephora makes you feel special, and it's why I've been moving away from Ulta and willing to come here more and more for my makeup needs.",1,wYTMFvw3_UetcniRKxtUzg

It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of ""Not my table."" ""Not my problem."" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us.

Ok so it's about 2 years since the previous review and not much changed. Our server tonight was not very good. We waited longer than we should have for her to come over and take our drink order. After waiting a long time for the drinks, they came and I had an incorrect beverage. She finally came back after 10 minutes and when I told her the drink was wrong, she laughed that she had given my drink to someone at another table. I was wondering why she waited for me to point that out to her when she had known that for several minutes.  I asked her for a straw when she brought the replacement beverage and it took about 10 minutes to get that. We put in our order and it  seemed to take a long time for the appetizer. We saw our dinner come up from the kitchen because we were sitting right next to the area by the open kitchen. Our server was busy stacking bowls and plates and we watched our food just sit there. During this time there were lots of servers and employees kind of standing around and no one bothering to bring us our dinner. When our dinner was finally brought over, you will be shocked to find out all the pasta was iced cold. We had to go up to the staff who was busy chatting and ask for a manager. He was apologetic to us, but when he went back to the open kitchen, we could hear him laughing at us with the chef. (Seriously, like he forgot this is an open kitchen area.). The server came over and was mortified that we had spoken to the manager. She never once apologized for anything.  He brought our pasta back and it was--meh. A lot of the noodles were stuck together and we don't think we got the garlic oil sauce we had ordered.

Let me tell you guys, I have always had 4 different insurance agents for my properties, vehicles, businesses, toys and all. It was such a headache and impossible to follow!
Until I met Cassidy and her awesome team!!! WOW, these guys are in top of it, always pricing out better options for me, on top of my payments and making sure I'm always current.
I would say the best thing is the personal care you get, it's as if they actually care about saving you every dime (even when you don't care for it) while maintaining a booklet proof insurance coverage for you and your loved ones.

p0iEUamJVp_QpaheE-Nz_g,0,2014-05-18,0,pC4Sy6ifn3IsSINB2jhDvg,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Here's a tip... STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! It's not as if there aren't plenty of other hotels in the area. I had to stay here, there was a convention I had to attend for work taking place at this location. The conference will most likely be here next year too and I'll make sure to stay somewhere else. 
The food is gross and overpriced. The service was not good. As soon as we landed we attempted to locate the ""free shuttle"" that they advertise for bringing guests from the airport to the hotel. When we couldn't locate it we called the hotel and they told us that the shuttle had to be reserved 24 hours in advance and it was full for the day. He was incredibly rude and in hindsight he should have prepared me for the customer service standard this hotel holds.
The worst part of my stay here was the customer service (or lack thereof). The temperature was in triple digits so we decided to try the pool. There are two pools (one large one  and one smaller one that is probably for kids) and when we got there the larger pool was fairly empty. We laid by the pool for a little and then I started to climb in the pool. After a few minutes of wading around a life guard whistled at me. Apparently they were cleaning the pool and guests weren't allowed in due to the presence of chemicals. No sign, nothing stating this. I would have appreciated some type of warning before stepping into a contaminated pool apparently filled with cleaning chemicals but oh well. After I got out I noticed other guests making the same mistake and I even heard one remark, ""why isn't the pool roped off?""
So everyone starts gathering in the smaller pool. Not even 15 minutes later everyone is kicked out of that pool as well. Apparently it was also contaminated. Lovely. And once again, no warning sign, no roped off area. Again I saw many people walk into it not knowing it was contaminated. Eventually we went up to the room because it was clear we wouldn't get any time in the pool.
We decided to come back later at night to use the hot tub and relax. There is one hot tub with a sign at the entrance clearly stating, ""No children under the age of 16 allowed in hot tub area"". However, there was absolutely no one enforcing it. So the hot tub was over-run with children, splashing and swimming as if they were in the pool. We asked the life guard if there were indeed children allowed in the hot tub and he assured us they were not and then he asked them to leave. One parent became belligerent about his child not being allowed in the hot tub and the life guard had to call security. Not exactly the relaxing atmosphere one would hope for. As soon as the life guard left the hot-tub once again became filled with children. So we left. 
When I got back to the room I called the front desk to tell them I was disappointed by the events described above. She was not sympathetic and actually told me that it was my fault for not asking the staff to ask the children to leave the hot tub. When I told her that I did and it didn't help she then told me I should have called her instead. She then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing she could do about it but would I like a $15 food credit to my room? I would have much rather appreciated a caring/understanding/apologetic customer service representative and no food credit rather than receiving a measly $15 food credit and having to deal with the rude and condescending representative. 

TL;DR

I don't know how you're supposed to enjoy your dinner with multicolored lights constantly giving you a headache. Perhaps it's enjoyable for some people (i.e. small children and people who are overly fond of 'busy' decoration), but I'm not one of them. The staff was rude and not really interested in giving you the time of day unless you were ordering copious amounts of alcohol. And the constant barrage of music rolling in from the casino downstairs was just adding insult to injury. 

We didn't try the food (so please don't use this review as a basis for that), but we did stop in for one of the ""giant brownie sundaes"". I will give them credit for having one of the largest sundaes I've ever seen. This thing was so big, in fact, that the four people at our table couldn't manage to finish it. The quality was so-so. The ""home-made"" brownie bites seemed more like something you'd get from a grocery store and the ice cream was okay, although I would have liked a better chocolate-to-vanilla ratio. 

Price-wise, it's not bad. You could definitely spend a lot more money for better food, but if you're on a budget and you don't mind the gaudy atmosphere and poor service this place may still be a good option for you.",0,bAK3Fl4aHEuCBfD_kMa7XQ

Being 2.5 hours away from Chicago, I am still looking for a great modern America cuisine restaurant that is not simply a steak house. Silvercreek is likely the best that Champaign has to offer, but it still falls short of a 4 or 5 star dining experience in Chicago. As soon as you step into the restaurant, the all brick wall and wood ceiling interior adds a bit of class to your meal. We went in the summer time, but I can imagine how rustic it would feel in the winter with the large fireplaces that are along the adjacent wall. The server was quick to take our orders and get the kids meals out first with the appetizer. We went with the appetizer sampler which had the shrimp cocktail served with blue cheese mousse with cocktail sauce (FYI they serve it in such a weird shot glass that I thought it was an oyster in cocktail sauce....), calamari fried exceptionally well, marinated olives with a sweet zest, and duck prosciutto wrapped dates. It was nice trying a bunch of apps on plate. My duck entree is where it losses some stars as only 3/4 of this was cooked well, the other 1/4 was too well done on the chewy side. The cauliflower and parsnip puree along with the shiitake mushroom roasted cauliflower complemented the dish well especially the freshness of the vegetables. I am also very concern why there was a dark blue discoloration in the duck breast as noted in my picture. The redeeming quality is the extensive options on the menu and some farm to table elements.

Pros: refined menu that utilizes many components to the dish, special dinner menu, Sunday brunch

Cons: What is up with the blue discoloration in the duck breast and 1/4 of it was way over done

Hidden deals:
1. Sunday brunch buffet- I need to come back and give this a try
2. Pre-fixe menu- not advertised on the website 3 course meal for 29.99
3. Global Wednesday- unique foods from around the world
4. Live music Friday night",1,qntQp9UoeP6ju8D_W0Y0cw

We were immediately greeted and seated by a gentleman working behind the counter. Their dining space is small and intimate, but still a good space for a large group. Shannon was our waitress and she was honestly great. She made suggestions when we asked about different foods and wasn't that over the top, annoying, wannabe nice waitress that I seem to find too often in Vegas. Moving on.

What's wrong with all these yelpers and their taste for Japanese food? Or Am I the weird one here? Honestly....4 stars?

Let me start by saying I did give this place 3 full tries. Each time ordering something new from the menu. Its a very convienent place for me to drop by since its so close by to my neighbourhood. 

Disappointing....

1st time I went here I ordered the usual benchmark Japanese food. Sashimi platter, Kaiso salad and some makimono rolls etc. Let me say, for the price paid it is definately NOT worth it. Be prepared to be hungry afterwards. The portions are small and the fish is comparible to any AYCE japanese place, except you can't order more. We also ventured out and decided to order the SUSHI PIZZA, which in my opinion should be renamed sushi FEETsa. It smelt like my feet after a week of going camping with one pair of socks. It was also rock solid and each bite I thought my tooth was going to crack. ALL these people raving about it are either working there, knows someone that works there or have no taste buds or sense of smell. (Sorry if I'm being harsh)

the 2nd time I came here we hesitated but didn't feel like cooking ourselves and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I ordered the Zosui and my gf ordered the Nabeyaki udon. they were both Meh. My rice was pretty damn soggy. almost like a risotto but far more bland. How can you screw this simple dish? *sigh* My gf's order was ok but for $16 bucks premium it was as satisfying as bowl of instant noodles with ingredients bought at any chinese grocery store. 

And the 3rd and FINAL time we came here (recently) was the final straw. We order the Shabu Shabu hot pot. Which we were craving for since last week we had an awesome chanko nabe. the verdict: IT was flipping HORRIBLE! The soup base came out as plain tap water with a seaweed floating in it. The ingredients provided were slices of beef (bought at any T&T I presume) and the rest were an assortment of various veggies. for $38 bucks a person.. c'mon now.. I honestly felt like I was on some ""Punk'd"" show and Ashton Kutcher was going to come out with a camera crew after I paid for this.

Nami, We gave you 3 tries. Each time an utter disappointment. My humble apologies NAMI you are officially on my blacklist.

So at the end she calls the manager, come to find out the were offering the heart pizza. Needless to say. Annoyed. Buiuuuut she was super nice. (Hence the two stars.)

He was patient and helpful with both of us as we were each looking for something different. I highly recommend requesting him if you stop by looking for an Audi. Not pushy and is really knowledgeable about the cars they sell as well as other brands of cars if you've having a tough time making a decision.

Very helpful to my friends and my husband who had never been to Angry Crab.  I don't remember his name, but when my friend's blue crab took almost a half hour longer than the rest of the table's food, our server expressed genuine concern and strived to make our experience  positive for the rest of the meal.  Management never visited the table, but he said management took care of it.  My two pounds of snow crab legs were perfectly cooked and delicious.  My husband's shrimp were way over cooked but he was okay with it.  

Service:  5 STARS.  Food:  3 STARS.

Hi Lovers!

I went on a dinner date to this place finally! I have to say I was impressed all around. Great inventive margaritas. I had a cucumber drink that was so refreshing for summer. Chips and guacamole were fresh and fabulous. We decided on splitting chicken tacos and a salmon special. The salmon special ended up being fabulous. A cream and pistachio sauce topped delicious roasted salmon. Homemade tortillas made this a great dish.
The space is very small. You think it is deeper and larger than it really is and I get why it can be hard to get a table. I do like that the kitchen is completely visible and you can watch them cook at the front of the restaurant. The bar is great to try to grabs a seat and actually eat and not wait!

While I'm thrilled with the recent (read: up to 5 years old) interest in teas, the rise in over-scented and novelty flavoured teas have irked me as a casual tea enthusiast. 

The traditional knowledge of Assamese, Korean or Sri Lankan Tea as far back as thousands of years is not to be compared with tea kitschily-titled Christmas Cuddles and Chocolate Hugs for the middle-aged midwestern Folgers lover. 

This is why I was very apprehensive of trying out T-Buds, as a tea emporium, particularly in this area. I'm so happy to write that I was extremely surprised with the results. 

T-Buds is a very cute tea cafe with a very well executed food pairing menu. Along with their very long list of traditional teas, they serve lattes and other specialty drinks. They also have a wide range of crepes, traditional afternoon tea snacks and salads. 

I tried the Assamese Malt tea with a savory crepe, the name of which I can't recall, but its quite safe to say that the savory crepes are well worth it. The tea was delicious and the service was fantastic. I didn't have to request extra hot water at any point.

I will return and in the meantime recommend T-Buds to all of my friends. Make sure you make a reservation, though. Try the Darjeeling, Japanese Sencha and the Puerh teas. You'll thank me for it.

Fresh is the place I go to when...

- I need to feel ""clean"", or ""detox"" from a bad week/day/month of overindulgence 

- I have an audition/tryout to attend the next day (or a few days before) and it involves wearing a bathing suit or something really form fitting

- I feel like boycotting meat

IN Vancouver, my favourite place is The Naam (open 24/7, all veggies!) so when I arrived in TO, I set out hunting for the next cool veghead place.

And so far, Fresh fills my veggie void. It's not overly expensive (though anyone would surely feel a tad ripped off paying $9 for a bowl of steamed veggies).

You can order tons of sides at $2-4 (hello, yam fries? normal fries? steam broccoli, kale, etc.). I like this arrangement, because if I'm feeling a little naughty, a small side of fries won't kill me, but an appy-sized plate of fries probably would make my butt and thighs upset.

Anyway - I digress. When you get there and if you're bringing out-of-towners, order the Quinoa battered onion rings. It looks interesting/impressive, very unique - you only get 5 bigass rings but trust me, they are worth it and if you start off with those, you won't be able to finish your meal.

Now, for your meal, I highly recommend one of their bowls. And if you get it with rice, request ""more veggies than rice"" - they are good at fulfilling that request. Buddha and Goddess are the best ones, and same with the Macrobiotic (micro?) bowl... clean and simple!

OH - and the soup. Oh, the soup. SOmetimes I'll just go for the soup - a cup or a bowl or a bowl with salad. The soup is great, its just pureed veg at the end of the day but my fave is the Jamaican spinach and zucchini - a lil spicy but great spices.

My regular garage door service company of 15+ years decided two months ago to leave me high and dry with a system that didn't work. Not even a phone call to tell me they weren't coming back. 

But just as the old saying goes ""one garage door closes, while another one opens"" 

Jessie showed up this morning with a smile, assessed the mess he was hired to clean up and then he smiled again. 

Jesse contacted Genie to diagnose the problem and about 2 1/2 hours later Jesse had removed my old garage door opener system and installed a brand new Genie garage door opener system from top to bottom. This time I smiled. Lol Jesse worked HIS ASS OFF today. And he genuinely looked like he loved every minute of it. 

This brings me to the huge difference between the old burnt out businesses and their miserable burnt out repairman they send to our homes, compared to what I experienced today. 

A relatively brand new business of 2 years and their fresh approach, who's LevelUp repair man is also the owner of LevelUp the company. I mean it's awesome to see somebody proud of what they do AND kicking ass at it! 

By the way Jesse told me he would be showing up somewhere between 9:30 and 10 AM! Huh? Not 8am to Noon? or 1 to 4pm? No? NO! Jessie has eliminated that big crock of bull pucky we have all just accepted all these years. 

I'm sticking with the new guy 
and his new approach! Smiles and all. LevelUp Garage Door! 5 Stars!

sj9osyqLyOy7b_kDZb1txA,0,2015-04-04 19:02:52,0,NftkcWXF_gtijWWptlE1Iw,"Normally, I don't give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what I left for Sanfratello's.  However, I decided to give them a second chance simply because they were closer than my normal Rosati's.

The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall. You really need your GPS to find the place.  But it is in the same lot as the Albertson's but closer to Warner than Lindsay.  Once you get there, you notice how small the place is (looks more designed for a takeout instead of dining in like their parent store in Tinley Park, IL).  You do have outdoor seating but that's even small.

One thing I found interesting is how quick they had a pan pizza ready.  I am accustomed to waiting 45 minutes.  They had my pizza ready in 25-30 minutes.

When I got the pizza, I was kind of taken aback because the container looked kind of small.  In fact, it almost reminded me of a personal pan pizza in physical size.  I even thought it was going to be a square pizza because of the rectangular container.

After taking the first bite, I saw that Sanfratello's uses the patty sausage similar to Pizzeria Uno and Due back in Chicago. With some of the crumbled sausage I have had, you do taste the seasonings through the meat.  In this case, I did not.  It did not have the full-bodied flavor I am accustomed to when eating a Chicago pizza.  

The second thing I noticed was the crust itself.  I have to admit I was skeptical that it would be cooked thoroughly because of the short time.  However, that concern was squelched.  However, I am also accustomed to a buttery crust.  This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots.  

Third was the tomato sauce. The sauce, like the sausage, was missing critical seasonings that provide the usual flavor explosions I am accustomed to with Chicago pizza.  Additionally, I did detect a bit of sweetness with the sauce which is abnormal.

All in all, I would say it's not a bad pizza but this former Chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious Rosati's competitor.",6,7eZobfrf7gai6iIpWDKTZw

We stopped in early in a Saturday and were told it would be a 50min wait but bar seating was first come first served. We decided to look around and found a table in the back corner of the bar. It took a little bit but our server finally came over and took our drink order. He was very knowledgeable with the wine list and my wife went with one of his suggestions for a Pinot Grigio and she enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on an entree so I went with some small plates. I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful but skimpy on the lobster. Next I had a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The salad was rather large and a good value. The calamari was excellent except for the aioli. I tried a little and decided to stick with the marinara that accompanied it. I'm a calamari traditionalist...what can I say? My wife had the pasta Brio which consisted of rigatoni, grilled chicken, and mushrooms in a roasted red pepper sauce. She liked it and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of chains but Brio does it right.

In 2006, we purchased a brand new Sienna from this dealership and it was the best experience I've ever had with a dealership.  

Since then, we've taken the van there for our regular service work and even had a great experience when our automatic side door needed repair.  The person I worked with went out of their way to get us the expensive replacement part for free since we had been loyal customers, we just paid for the labor.  I've recommended this place many times and have bragged how happy I was with dealership. I had even planned on our next vehicle purchase coming from this place.

My problem is with the last time I took my vehicle to get service work done.  Our A/C stopped working and we took it in to hopefully get repaired along with our normal service work.  Their customer service is great as usual, but my problem is with this quote.

Replacement of A/C Compressor - Over $1900
Water pump and timing belt - Almost $800

I realize dealerships often cost more than taking it to a garage, but this quote is way too high.  I've researched average cost of this kind of service.  And have also looked at average estimates for dealers and auto shops from AutoMD.  

Maybe this is norm for dealerships now.  I've had friends who've suggested that these high quotes are to try and entice a new car sale.  I hate to feel that way, but now I'm starting to wonder.  I guess I'm feeling a little betrayed.",5,gjlhzR5eyMU-JVyeiuIeAw

We waited and waited and finally here came our 25 anniversary celebration on July 5.  Our expereince started with a smiley beautiful lady giving us a brief introduction of the history and design of the restaurant.  We were told that this steak house is the one Chef Ramsay freqently visits.  It rasied our hope that the food MUST be outstanding.  Our waiter is escellent.  Very friendly, attentive and informative.  Gave us good recommendations on drinks and food choices.   The bread selection was good, foie gras was excellent and the seafood tower was amazing.  But we were totally disappointed when the Kobe beef steak (8oz) and the Royal Long Horn steak came.  We ordered medium rare and medium respectively but both of them apeared to be burnt, especially with the Kobe  beef.  This dish will definitely be sent back to kitchen if Chef Ramsay was on site, REGARDLESS of the value!  We expected the famous Kobe beef to have marble texture and melt in the mouth but it was chewy and blend.  We had Kobe beef steak in Japan before and that was way better.  The Long Horn steak was slightly overcooked too. The sticky toffe pudding which came with the butter ice-cream matched beautifully, however, the coffee we picked was another disappointment.  It's worse than a donut shop coffee !.  Our bill was almost $800 for 3 but with that qualify of entree we had, totally not worth it.  Again, we believe, according to what we saw on TV about Chef Ramsay's high standard and requirements,  he would never allow the entree to leave the kitchen.  After all, the whole dinning experience was like riding a roller coaster ended with a sad face :(",0,b1qKCVkKman3AD1IVm2wfA

First, like the other reviewers mention, this is a 70's - 80's design, and while my room was somewhat updated, I can see where others have not been.

While spacious for one person, the room felt a little too open with the mirrored closet at the entrance and tile floors reflecting the light around.  Not a bad thing mind you, but somewhat odd.

The carpet was not comfortable to bare feet and was a brownish color.  The mini fridge was spotty at best, and the AC was a tad noisy at times, but I slept through it ok.  Perhaps my biggest complaint was the shower.  It took more than 5 minutes for hot water to come out of the shower (the tub heated nicely however).  Also, the shower head shot the water in a concentrated stream with a lot of pressure, similar to a pressure washer.  Personally, I like my water spread out :)  The wifi was also pretty spotty in my room, often times dropping for no apparent reason.

I would probably stay here again if I was in the area for a conference at the center, but if I had a choice to stay elsewhere, I probably would.

Edit:  I forgot to mention the service....A+ in that department.  Everyone was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way on several occasions to make sure everything was to my liking.  So while the facilities need updating, the staff is perfect as is.",1,BN8-xCNTAqG7T8f5_5X0QQ

I had never visited Peixoto, since it's pretty far from where I live and even as I was driving over I kept muttering to myself, this better be worth it! But I had an excuse to be in downtown Chandler, and I'm here to report, I think Peixoto has just ruined every other coffee experience I've ever had. They are just that good!
I came to Peixoto and ordered my usual order, something I get at all coffee shops, an iced mocha latte with soy. The baristas told me that the espresso beans are sourced from Familia Peixoto, just like their coffees, which has notes of hazelnut, honey, and berries. There was also bits of chocolate from the local chocolate shop, Zak's chocolate, in my drink, and it was love at first sip- it was seriously one of the best lattes I've had in my entire life! The flavors blended in a way that just made me smile - not too sweet, not too strong, it was just perfect, just smooth and delicious. And again, I have serious lived in places with serious caffeine addictions, and Peixoto's brews are definitely up there. 
I was so impressed, and so curious, and a little terrified, that Peixoto is so far from me that I'd never get to try it again that I ordered another latte, this time from the seasonal menu, the Matcha Mel latte. It was good, not as bitter as some matcha lattes can be, but I think I was still won over by my original order. 
After two regular lattes, I probably was high on caffeine, and there are so many things on the menu I want to come back for! This includes the seasonal Coco Latte that has condensed milk, the affogato with gelato, and the days they carry Welcome Chicken & Donuts, donuts.
I did hear they partnered with Urban Cookies so you can now pick up some brews in Phoenix, but I feel like I will make up some excuse to come over here again to Chandler.
Aside from their products themselves, the staff was extremely nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I learned that they source their beans from Brazil and are all fair trade. I love that they partner with other local food eateries, and even their matcha is supplied by Gotcha Matcha, another reputable source.

The place was happening. I realized later its a franchise in the city. I ordered one of their few vegetarian options, a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled mushrooms. And a side of cajun spiced fries. Both were stupendously good (and stupendously unhealthy). My grilled cheese consisted of two slices of 'bread' (more like savoury pancakes) with heaping amounts of cheese and mushrooms dripping out. The serving size was smallish (imagine a slightly overstuffed egg mcmuffin) but very filling. In comparison they overfilled my serving of fries (and I ate every single one...oh what a carb feast).

It will cost you around $10-12 for a main, fries and drink. I wish they had poutine options, guess I will have to save that tasting event for another local establishment :)",0,ouS-Douov6w19Xly4aKLHQ

The only place in Vegas my voucher was valid for was the Riviera and I figured, ""how bad can it be?""  Old Vegas has it's charm, it's still on the Strip, so I thought it would be fine.

Esh.  Where do I start?  First off, the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary.  Everytime we got in them, someone would remark that we were going to die, the cables would creak, and it was just freaky.  It got to the point where we started walking the 6 flights of stairs just to avoid the scary elevators.  We also started parking in the uncovered lot just past the garage, just to avoid the elevators!

Check-in?  Slow like molasses.  

Shops?  Lame.  The only good stores are the ABC stores, which have very reasonable prices.

The room?  It looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s, except for a flat screen TV and iHome alarm clock.  The clock still had the wrong time and nobody had changed it since daylight savings ended.  The AC in our room rattled all night and we had to slap the panel in the ceiling to get it to stop.  Every hour it would start again.  We really should've asked for our money back at that point.  The walls were thin so we could hear the guy next door yelling at his kids at 7AM.  The curtains didn't close all the way, so we woke up when the sun came up.

The bathroom was okay, but there wasn't even a stopper in the sink.  I was paranoid I would lose an earring down that thing.  The sink pipe ran into the wall and it was just ghetto, like someone just freehand cut a circle in the wall and stuck a pipe through it.  The toilet was like an industrial toilet you see in public restrooms, so I used my foot to flush it every time.

Oh, and the Riviera is still on the Strip, however, it's really far from anywhere you'd want to go, so you can't really walk anywhere.  Thankfully, we had our car, so we just drove everywhere.",1,yRHiw7gVfQdc0Wd7XpcVmQ

That was as recently as about 2 years ago and now I can't get enough.  I don't think it's the restaurant that changed,  it was my appreciation for homestyle food. 

Grab a tray and some silverware and slide down the line making your selections like you did in school, only with far more and better choices.  
First are salads...garden, macaroni,  weird pea salad...all kinds of salad.
 Next in line are desserts.  Yeah it's a little weird layout.  There are several different pies including sugar free,  cakes, banana pudding, and cobblers. If they have strawberry cobbler you should get that.
 Next up are the meats. Everything rotates but you can usually expect a meatloaf, some sort of fried chicken, both fried and baked fish, and maybe some spaghetti or chicken n dumplings.  
My favorite - the side dishes. Mac and cheese, creamed corn,  carrots,  pintos, green beans, fried okra, dressing,  mashed potatoes and gravy, cabbage and probably twice that. 
Finally we have breads. I always say I'm not going to get bread because I already got so much but it calls my name. They have rolls the size of my head that glisten with butter, really good mexican cornbread,  and other assorted breads that I never choose because those I mentioned are so good. 

Highlights: strawberry cobbler, mac and cheese,  dressing, okra, and chicken with white gravy. Omg last time I had it, it was better than my momma's fried chicken.",3,qWFc8k7e61RmCJL2xQmWRA

This was much much much better! The gyros were really juicy and the toppings were all fresh. What put this place over the top was the spicy tzatziki which was amazing and generously applied.

My one knock would be the menu is a bit confusing. I was unsure how many sides you got if you made it into a combo. Turns out its one side, I opted for fries which were good and plentiful.

Decided to go on the bartender advice and get a margarita which I hated. 
Drank maybe 4 or 5 sips and asked the bartender for a beer as I didn't care for the margarita she made me. She dumped it and got me the beer. 
Received my Bill and was told because I drank from it I would have to pay for it. 
Asked her how I'm supposed to know if I don't like something of I don't drink from it? Bartender told me, that's just what the manager said. So I asked to speak with her. 
Before she even arrived at my table you could tell she wasn't even willing to hear what I had to say. As soon as I stated what had happened I was told by the so called ""owner/manager"" That they hate customers like me. 
And I asked her what she meant by customers like me. She stated ones who try to get free.  
I told her I used to work in restaurant and I used to bartend myself and before I could even finish what I was saying to this ""owner/manager"" she said I don't care what you do. She make you the best margarita. 
I asked her how she (owner/manager) could possibly know that as she didn't make it herself. 
Needless to say she continue to tell me that I should have told the bartender I didn't like it before I even tried it if I didn't want to pay for it. 
And again I continuously tried to tell this lady it's not that I didn't want to pay for it-- I clearly wanted to pay for it as I had ordered it because it is what I wanted-- but I did not like it and it wasn't made ""the best"" 
And it definitely was not the best margarita I've ever had it was way too sour and way way too salty. 
I suggest that you take your business elsewhere. 
They clearly have no idea what customer service is or even cares about customer service. 
Don't waste your money on folk who don't even care if their regular customers are happy. They sure as shit won't care if your once in a while pop in is happy.",2,BWTFjt-UrltvdHMzc0EaCg

I scored myself a 3 veggie plate ( I chose fried squash, green beans and yams) with a roll, and a side of ranch for dippin' fried squash for a fiver and change. The fried squash were thin, hot and crispy. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte ( since Louis's is technically in Harrisburg) and the green beans were tasty too. I'm not well versed in yams but I like mine a touch more al dente than how they serve them up here but that's just a minor critique since they still tasted good.

The staff was super friendly. The lady that took my to go order made sure I got my food fast and even used my name when she handed me my order ( always a nice touch). The owner ( I assume) was around and was also wonderfully chatty and helpful.

Beer menu is very interesting with their own brews and food menu although short is mouth-watering with good food and vegan option which as always doesn't come cheap.
We shouted our order to the waitress (see reason below) and got a blonde and a white beer, the Tempeh sandwich and the cheese board. We found nothing exciting with any of it and for the price, were still hungry.

The service was attentive. The food came out pretty fast which was a plus since we only scheduled one hour for this meeting. There wasn't that many people at 1:30pm, so it was quiet for us to talk. 

We all wanted meat so none of us tried the vegan menu. They looked pretty delicious on the pictures. I will come back and try them later. From the regular menu, the server recommended enchiladas and creamy poblano chicken. I went with the chicken enchiladas. One of my colleague got the shrimp enchiladas and queso with chips and salsa and the other one got the carne asada nachos. Both of us who got the enchiladas were satisfied with our entrees. Not my coworker who got the carne asada nachos. She only had few chips.  

Chicken enchiladas (4/5): I enjoyed my dish. The flavor was great. However, the chicken was a bit dry. 

Carne asada nachos (2:5): I tried a few. I didn't like the carne asada. It has a lot of fatty chewy beef. Not enough cheese either.

When I was 15, I took acid with some friends, only to find out my over-bearing mother had made an appointment to get my hair cut that same day...can you see where this is going? A few Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related episodes later...I decided to get my hair cut.
 What really irks me about a lot of Salons, is simply put - I felt like I was under a microscope from the moment I went in, to the Stylist deciding they either didn't like what I wanted and decided to improvise, or they completely disregarded what I'd specifically told them (ie. ~this~ long here..no shorter).
 Steinberg's is NOT like that at all. It's the complete opposite of most Salon's I've ever been to. The Staff are all very outgoing, professional and receptive to your needs. 
 I've only had my hair cut by Samantha - she has an outstanding sense of style and isn't above giving you feedback as to why this/that wouldn't ""work"" on you, rather than just going through the motions and doing whatever she wants, just so she can have the next client in her chair faster.",5,bubCIa8tqeWGyTlBjxvuLg

These burritos are not only massive, but filled with fresh ingredients you can't get at the franchise burrito joints. There are several options of burritos, but their menu isn't that extensive. Don't go here looking for a Mexican restaurant, go here only if you want burritos or quesadillas. From black to pinto, chicken to beef to fish, & several other options, Phat Burrito provides enough of an option for the whole group to enjoy the kind of burrito each person likes. The salsa bar also has some different options to top your burrito with, & you can try as many as you wish.

This place is pretty tiny, with not much room for indoor eating. When the weather is nice, the patio is a good option & is right next to the light rail. The lunch crowd is always huge & most people take their food as takeout, so expect to wait a good while to order, & wait for seating as well if you plan to stay. The parking lot can sometimes be a hassle as well.

Phat Burrito is so much better than your normal Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. types. Phat Burrito gives you a much better tasting burrito, without a high price, & will have you going back again & again to this unique little joint.",0,kjYbPkrbgPMVUAjungJ4Aw

You can order flights of beer (4 different samples) for under $10 if you aren't sure what you are looking for. I really enjoyed the bear mountain and their extra stout, but my favorite was their cider. I highly recommend the cider and am hoping to find it bottled somewhere to purchase.

The sushi is good enough, but most of their rolls are drowning in cream cheese, and while I am a fan of the cheese that is creamed it can seriously get to be too much at this place.

The only other thing I have to say that was a major factor in the three star rating was the customer service. Every one working there looked like they hated working there, they hated the people they worked with, and they hated their lives in general.

They had some extra herbage in them- but I couldn't quite pick it out. Hubby had the yogurt granola that was really good. The yogurt had lemon in it and the granola was super high quality. This morning I had the special which was a cheddar biscuit sliders with egg and sausage. I could only finish one and hubs had clean up duty. He was not upset by this.,0,mVujWzkq56Rf88w-9HuPIQ

After looking over the menu I decided to order a beer and a roll of sushi (let me clarify) ONE roll of sushi, and my friend decided to get some ramen. After about 10 mins go by, they bring out the ramen but no sushi. I wasn't in a huge rush so no worries - I understand it can get busy in the kitchen. Five mins go by, then ten, then 15, and finally 20. By this time my friend had completely finished his meal, I had finished my beer, and the hour of parking I paid for was 10 mins to expiring. 

Let me also add, halfway through my friend eating, they decided to ask for ID as they wanted to open up the partition between the patio and restaurant. He's only 20 but this issue shouldn't arise halfway through a paying customers meal.

My server, Sage, had came to our table several times during this wait amazed I still didn't have my food and actually checked back to the kitchen 2-3 times for me before I finally received it (she was great). But I have never in my life had to wait 30 mins for a roll of sushi. 

Upon receiving my food, the manager decides to come over to explain how ramen takes two mins to make while sushi somehow takes 30 mins (because it's an ""entree"" and somehow ramen isn't?) - all he could say was ""I understand, BUT..."". All he needed to say was, ""I apologize is there anything I can do to make it better?"" - that would have made the difference between me writing this yelp review or not.

He offered me free edamame but seeing as I had just gotten my ""entree"" and had finished my beer, I countered the offer by asking if they could refill my glass so I had something to enjoy my meal with; he begrudgingly accepted. However, when I got the bill I was charged $8 for a draft beer - even if I had gone to a club up the street I would have paid max $5.50 to $6 for the same product accompanied by better service, and better management. I paid the bill, tipped the waitress and got out of there before anything else could go wrong. All in all, this place is a JOKE. Please, if you're trying to enjoy your evening DO NOT go to this ""restaurant.""",1,fRAcAxlLtTCJlYU_HgGeFw
C6C_dc78Zhzei9wrZs-tdQ,0,2011-07-08 13:59:11,1,Qy4J9KZoItb5-8d2mlSpow,"My buddy stayed here so I got a chance to check out the rooms and casino floor.  Yes, it's aged and they still have coin operated slot machines, but it wasn't horrible.  My buddy stayed in the main building (i.e. not the tower or cabana suites).  He mentioned the price was $40/night and they comp you $20 in food per night and $20/night in slot play.  Not too shabby!  

His room was nothing more than a typical room at a Super8.  It had two double beds and a tiny bathroom, all of which were dimly lit by energy saving bulbs.  The walls were thin and you were pretty much outside until you walked into your room.  So there were no corridors or anything.  Pretty ghetto but hey, you're here to crash after long nights of drinking and gambling.  

The El Cortez has free parking but the garage is located about 200 yards from the hotel casino.  I imagine many of the people staying there are packing lightly anyway.  

We played there on a couple nights during our stay in Vegas.  They have $3 video blackjack - you know the one with the cheap porn stars as your dealer?  :-)  They have a couple of $5 blackjack tables, and enough slot machines to keep you happy for a day or two.  You'll probably get bored of this place quickly and if you want something more upbeat, you'll have to head over to the Fremont Experience (think Golden Nugget or Binyans).

This place is aged, as is the majority of the players in the casino, but if you're looking to get away from the rowdy crowd and not spend so much at their tables, give this place a try.  It may be a little intimidating sitting down next to a 70 yr old at the blackjack table but just remember you're playing against the dealer, not him.",1,nT9alA4GvQEcpviGMm1jtQ

Best burger in Toronto.  The genius is in the simplicity. 

If you want saffron scented kobe beef with garlic aoli and frise on a spelt ciabatta...... don't go here.  

If you want a real, back to basics, fresh ingredients, beautifully griddled, old school burger:  GO HERE! 
 
The comparison to In-N-Out is fair, but Burger's Priest is a small run operation that has much fresher, better ingredients, seasoning, and service.  They grind their own beef and griddle it to perfection.  When I'm in Toronto I don't crave In-N-Out, but when I'm in California I crave The Burger's Priest!

The cheese burger is heaven.  The double double is a devilish delight.  I'm dying to try The Option, but I'm so in love with the beef I have to have it.  

Be warned:  Most walk-in closets are bigger than the space they have for customers.  I have sat at one of the four stools every time I'm there, because I can't wait to put the burger in my mouth.  But maybe would be better option to take out, especially if you have more than two people.

I actually remember the old Pittsburgh airport. I've done a ton of flying out of both the old and this new(er) version and the new(er) version is a complete improvement. Still, I wish the food options were more plentiful, open later, and spread more equally throughout the concourses. Security here is relatively tame (line speaking) when compared to more heavily traveled airports. PIT is no longer a HUB so it sees much less traffic these days. It's easy to navigate, there are no insanely long walks to terminals (I'm looking at you DCA!), and it's, relatively, clean. Moving walkways are always good, I never find this airport crowded, and if you forget reading material for your flight (I'm very guilty of this), there are abundant outposts to grab media to read. I appreciate there is free drop-off parking if you're there less than an hour since I and my brother semi-frequently fly here to visit my parents and need dropped off after. I know my parents, as Pittsburgh residents, wish there were more direct flights out of PIT. Even my brother, flying home to Boston, recently had to connect from PIT to Newark (???) then to Boston-I'm not sure why they couldn't do a direct flight more than once a day (which is why he had to book connecting) for that. Staff is at least good with kids-I've flown numerous times as a minor (many, many moons ago) alone and I always had a good experience. My  parents say security is now quick, but they also fly pretty frequently and are pre-approved for TSA. Overall, I think the breadth of flights was better when Pittsburgh was still a HUB, but it (mostly) gets our divided (by distance) family to where we need to go so that's a plus still!",1,gFsqraWQfG46ohVFRg_d3A

When I asked out of my contract cause they couldn't employ people to provide the service they sold me, they said they were only able to let me out based on medical issue, or pay out half my contract. They don't live up to their end and then expect you to pay, so my advice is avoid this place like the plague. Don't sign up with them and don't sign any contracts with them.

The service was also fantastic and the server kept asking us if everything was okay and was very prompt. 

For the food, we ordered: one Summer Dinner Prix Fixe which included: Salmon with Risotto and an Avocado Caesar Salad, one Pizza Salmone and one Penne Capri substituted for Spaghetti.

We ordered the king crab which was meaty and juicy.  I would suggest ordering the bread to sop up all of the juice inside the bag which was really delicious and flavorful. They had a decent selection of beers that were reasonably priced. Be prepared for a shockingly loud siren to go off when someone orders the spiciest sauce or is celebrating a birthday. We initially happened to be sitting right next to the siren and almost fell off of our barstools, luckily we held onto our frosty beverages and they saved us!  Would rate this a 3.5 if I could.

Take in mind this review is based solely on my breakfast purchase of the tastiest chicken biscuit I have had to date.

The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.  The biscuit was soft, fluffy and also had a great buttery flavor as well.  Hand in hand the cajun chicken paired perfectly with the biscuit, which I might add was hearty in size as well.  

I would SO opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spicy chicken biscuit from Chick-Fil-A because sometimes theirs is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level.

Whenever I get back to these parts, I am going to look for a Bojangles and tear up another biscuit, lol.  The fried chicken looks fantastic so I know I want to try that also.  Lucky all of you that have one of these nearby; can you airmail me one, lol",3,6BOt_r4AfCa0HHcxD112UQ

If you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.

Facilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.

Services: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.

Value: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).

We checked in very late due to the event we were participating in didnt allow us to get to the hotel before. We walked in and found our room was 2 double beds. I called the front desk and spoke to Diana and her excuse was ""its just a request that is why we upgraded you for free"". Um no...we had already paid for this suite there was no upgrade. She sat there and argued about what we were given ""for free"". Which was nothing because we prepaid foe the room. I finally get manager who said that he'd hold the right room for us the next night but the bed selection is only a request. So though 3 months ago we requested a king bed it didn't really mean anything. Fine. Whatever. He promises someone will bring us keys, just let the desk know when we were ready. We tried to order some food but were immediately told it would be over an hour so we went to bed starving. The next morning.... Our lanai is a view of the air conditioner vents. Our shower drain doesn't really drain and the air conditioner never really stopped. We couldn't wait to get out of the room which I'm sure was an ""emergency overfill"" room.  We stop by the front desk (9am) and let them know when the room is ready so are we. ""Ok the manager will call you at ###.#### phone number when its ready"" by 3:30 still no call. So I call again to the front desk and speak to the same lady I spoke with that morning. ""Oh, they haven't called you? That room has been ready for hours! Come down with a valid ID and pick up keys."" We finally get into the room with the lanai we wanted but its now to late to enjoy. 

Everytime we came off the elevator someone from the hotel was trying to sell us something. They wouldn't take a no and would follow us a bit trying to get us to stop after we've said no.

rUy2MtHyFv8pI7FOW1DE8w,0,2018-01-06 16:01:07,0,9SpsPN8MAjIvnhCGOkLTyQ,"OK.  As you can see, I gave Pino's a Four Star review. Also, please notice that this is a two part review.
Part One:
Last night was my first night at Pino's.  The interior is warm and inviting and a seat by the windows was great.  We got there when they just opened so there was still some prep work going on and for me that's just fine.  Ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan and I have to say that it was one of a very few that ranked as excellent!  The only problem was that the cherry was stemless and had a pit, which, for my dining companion, was a BIG surprise.  The bread and  Sundried Tomato spread was excellent.
For Starters, I had the evening special Chicken Liver Mousse which was presented on French toast rounds and accompanied by a pickled slaw with dried cherries.  It was very pleasant and a good choice.  For an Entree I chose the Braised Beef Sugo, which was a portion of numerous slices of braised beef served over linguini and covered with the braising liquid. All of the pastas were fresh and made in house. The beef was pull apart tender, but very under-salted.  There were also no salt or pepper shakers to be seen and also no ground pepper offered by the server.  I would have liked the chance to season my meal to my taste...not the chefs.
For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse with berries.  The mousse was a textural surprise for me.  Instead of light and fluffy, it was more of an ice cream consistency.  Very low on sweetness but all the same very enjoyable.

Now, Part Two:

If you're going to serve pasta dishes for $25.00 plus, You need to re-appraise your status and classification.  The restaurant tends to lean more towards upscale but at a better, affordable price point.  The interior is attractive, there are linens on the tables, the candles were very clever with the flame surrounded by coffee beans and the service was very good. 
 Things that I think should be considered are:
-New choice of cherries for bar drinks.  Hopefully w/o pits, or at least a verbal warning from the server.
-Salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Swallow your pride.  Not every meal is going to be placed in front of someone sharing your same taste buds.
-Coffee.  The coffee was great.  Usually I take cream and sugar but I was able to drink this coffee black just like a grown-up.
-Cream.  Really?  Little plastic creamers?  Really?  You're selling noodles for $25.00 and you can't present the coffee course with a bit more panache?  Spring for some inexpensive metal creamers and perhaps present it with the sugars on a small tray with the beverage.
- The Disco Menu Board.  What is usually reserved to announce the nightly Beer, Wing and Rib Platter is used here to tell, I don't know who, about tonight's specials.  All painstakingly hand written by an employee who possesses excellent calligraphic skills.  All, of course, done in vivid day-glo colors which screams at you when the black light is turned on.
Why not try a simple frame with easy rear access to just hang a copy of the specials with a title of ...maybe...Tonight's Selections.  Keep a few spaced out on the bar for any patrons having a pre-dinner cocktail.
If you insist on keeping this Twentieth Century example of advanced technology, then why not mount one of those singing fish right above it.

I really did enjoy my experience at Pino's, but I think you reached your goal a while back but kept over doing and adding to an already spot on formula.",1,_2V8aiV6EdrOMi3ilTlTPg

Started with deep fried pickles which were sliced into nickle sizes pieces, different from the quartered pickles that you usually would see.
Pulled pork was really good, although admittedly the one flaw was the cilantro in the coleslaw that was on top. I really don't like cilantro, but it was still a good sandwich.
Lunch with 4 beers, an app, 2 sandwiches, and aside of fries came out to just over $90 after tax and tip. Not a cheap lunch, but the atmosphere and quality of the food make it a worthy stop.",0,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g

The place was acceptably clean, busy, and the service was friendly and fast. While that was all good and fine, the reason we went there was to eat something delicious, and that was not the case. The food wan either delicious nor horrible.. My bacon and avocado omelet was super salty and had a weird taste which reminded me of a dirty grill. The country potatoes were the size of petite green peas and were a pain to eat. The pancakes were small and didn't taste like anything. The island platter was entertaining, because other than a chunk of pineapple, there was nothing island about it. Steamed white rice....not islandy or delicious at all. The Benedict was well prepared, but again nothing popped out in terms of flavor.

We really wanted this place to be way better and add it to our list of top breakfast places, but that didn't happen. There are lots more places to grab breakfast locally, and we are going to pass on this and keep looking.",0,c4yp3mrbOKqIuMF-qL7Amw

VxCnyVYn-FFgv6F1EqbdKA,1,2007-12-12 17:37:45,0,QJmlOpjwwDO9pmmDZQRWdg,"This is a review of the Gold Coast's coffee shop steak special.  You see it touted on some websites as one of the best in Las Vegas deals.  I think it is a decent belly stuffer but not a great deal for most people.  It is probably very popular because they keep A-1 steak sauce on the table unlike most places where you have to ask for it.

This is the $10.95 16 oz. T-bone.  The salad is decent size and they put a lot of blue cheese dressing on the salad which included olives, a few slices of cucumbers and tomato.  The quality of the blue cheese dressing was pretty good with visible chunks of blue cheese.

The steak was accompanied by 3 potato halves, 2 onion rings, 1 halved Texas Toast, a miller or bud (I forgot which one) baked beans and a lettuce garnish.

Baked beans were okay--probably Heinz out of a can.  The 2 onion rings were more like garnish than a true side but actually pretty good-- one of the better onion rings.  The potatoes tasted like they were lightly fried with a crispy top but they could have been baked.  There was a slight fishy flavor but under the crust they tasted okay.

The big disappointment was the steak. It is fairly thin, about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick which means that it is difficult to get a medium rare type of consistency through it all.  Also, it had a fair amount of gristle.  

I remember the last time I ate there I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the meal.  However, I've read that because steak prices have been going up that places are substituting Choice for Prime and even Select for Choice.  I think that Gold Coast may have done that here.

You still get enough to eat because the toast is thick, the salad large and you have baked beans but they are all fillers.  The star of a steak dinner is the steak and I think it is worse than I remember.  If you want to fill up this is still a great deal.  If you have eaten here before when it was better, you may want to reconsider.",1,DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg

The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  

The cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  

Other bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!

Panda Express is a chain and I personally know that they have locations from Philly to Phoenix because I have been to them first hand and definitely know what I am talking about, but this review is for one SPECIFIC location so listen up. This place has Chinese food, and basically everyone who works there is Chinese I think, so by definition that's pretty authentic. The food quality here has a pretty big range, depending on when you show up. If it's a busy time and lots of people are ordering then it's pretty fresh and delicious, and there's a lot to choose from. If you come at an off-time, then expect that the food has been sitting under their little heat lamp glass armor fort thing for a while, and might not be up to your high standards, but if that's the case I guess you're the one who screwed up because I already warned you about that in my review, you big dungus!

The atmosphere here is actually pretty nice for a fast food joint. It's on the corner of a shopping center and there's lots of windows and good seating so if you're going to hang out, you can just look out the window at the people walking by, and there's a McDonalds just outside and you can make faces at the people in the drive thru.

As for the service, it's pretty average. The people are nice, and they let you sample things if you want, but nobody's ever been particularly excited to serve me Chinese food there, which I guess makes sense because I wouldn't be excited to do that either.",0,jn6vn65m8uwXLmaTXtQkRw

Booking at 3 person reservation still meant sitting at the bar, but like many reviews noted, this is not a bad thing because 1) you get to see the food prepared and 2) purse hooks and 3) amazing lighting for food pics. 

What we ordered:

Bamboo - cocktail off the main menu with melon liqueur and 1.5 oz alcohol. Delicious and light, but not much in terms of booze.
Chicken Karaage - fried chicken is always a keeper - juicy inside, crispy outside
Beef udon - we needed some carbs too - was ok, but not the highlight
Salmon and 7 friends - beautifully displayed, server mixes up the dish and eat with seaweed. Delicious and salmon was so fresh.
Black cod sushi - beautifully served, and yummy. Love the big portions
Grilled black cod - this came last and was sizzling off the plate. Sweet and delicate, HIGHLIGHT!
Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce.
Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.

Food, as always, was amazing. I'm just not a fan of the noise level - it was migraine level at some point and couldn't have a conversation with my friends. One of us was always shouting: ""...wait, WHAT??""

I ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast. I also had a mimosa. 

My husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad. He also ordered a bloody mary. 

We also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce.

What I hate about many carpet cleaning companies is they will try to bait you in with a cheap price and then try to change that price so many times for extra things which is all nonsense and simply a bait and switch tactic,  I really hate these people who do this and so many of them do it. I can be really hard sometimes to find a company who doesn't. These guys Keystone Carpet Care, LLC on North Green Valley Pkwy in Henderson are the best you can get. They came out with a Truck Mount and before you knew it they were done, and did a fantastic job, no sales pitch, no changing of the price, just super fast, super efficient, very professional and did a real professional job. There is no substitute for a Truck Mount machine, I ran my business with portable units, and although a good job can be achieved, there is no substitute for a truck mount with two guys who know how to use it. If you want your carpets done right and you want it done quickly so you can get on with your day, you will be happy with this company. I had Luis come out and believe me these guys know what they're doing. I will be recommending them to others and using them myself in the near future. I've tried cleaning my own carpets with one of these personal Hoover type machines you get on Amazon or Target, but they cannot compare to this type of professional cleaning, their Truck Mount has got real power in terms of water heat, water pressure, and suction, it's worth it to me to just call them up and have them come out and get it clean for me in a fraction of the time it takes me to do it. I'm really happy with the service and very glad I found a company who obviously knows what they're doing. Happy New Years!",0,RAMh_p85LjywsLLen5RT4Q

He said to us and I quote ""JUST SO you know by switching plates I have to charge you, I knew it was going to happen it happens all the time I normally let it slide while at the table but JUST SO you know if you take any home or ask for refills I will have to charge you"" and it wasn't said in a quite voice either it was said loud enough so that other patrons could hear what was being said. I have never felt so humiliated while dining out ever!! There are ways to word things and get the point across in a polite and professional manner the way he handled the situation was completely uncalled for and very disrespectful. We were so embarrassed by the situation that we didn't even finish eating the soup or salad and requested boxes to box our barely touched dinners. We allowed him to box our dinner to ensure that he knew we weren't going to ""steal"" the remaining soup or salad. This experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never visit this particular location!! If I could give this location 0 stars for the service I would!",1,nvub7PKyeVhyRm9kf3G9yw

2tuyNTCkBBn6182GixQTng,3,2011-09-06 14:33:37,3,6lfcP7oTdxrzuV0Q6h2-2Q,"Lobby/Check In:

The Radisson in my mind is a little bit older and grungy at times. Basically, a chain of hotels that meets basic needs. However, this Radisson far surpassed my expectations. 

The lobby is clean and modern and extremely comfortable chairs dot corners and walls. High ceilings give the entrance a bright airy look.

Check-in was a pleasure. It is a two-person counter which means at a busier time slot, be prepared to wait a bit, however, I was fortunate to have checked-in at 5pm and it was a breeze. We were asked if parking was necessary, given hotel keys (two sets), explained where the main restaurant was located (The Watermark), a 25% gift certificate for dinner at The Watermark, and were provided the password for free Wi-Fi access. 

Room Number 712. 

There are 8 floors in total. We stayed on the 7th floor, and again, the room far surpassed my expectations. First impressions: clean smell (unlike some hotels where you can smell that bathroomy-curtain-shower-mildewy smell...), modern (signature dark woods), comfortable (lounge chair in the corner) and surprisingly large for a city-view room. 

What makes this room feel even more comfortable are the two large windows on either side of the wall providing lots of light to flood in. A working table and a television provide all the basic amenities one can ask for. As a FYI, there is no mini-bar but a fridge where you can put drinks and food in. A coffee machine is provided with coffee and tea and two cups (all clean).

Bathroom was very clean. Signature amenity kit provided with products of no particular brand. Hairdryer is attached to the wall (not a standalone). One nice feature was the shower curtain where they had a big see-through mesh strip (near the top of the curtain) so you can look out. I thought this was a nice touch so that it is not too dark when you are showering (sometimes thick curtains can be a tad claustrophobic). 

Bed was very comfortable with lots of different size pillows to cater to everyone's taste. 

Noise-Level.

I think this should be a category on its own when reviewing rooms - nothing can be worse than hearing annoying things or sounds (especially when you are trying to sleep!)

The hotel is very close to Queens Quay main street so if you book a city view room, be prepared to hear the street cars rumbling by. I have to say however that this was not a major problem for me. I am very noise sensitive and something as inconsequential as a car driving by can have me stay up for hours on end. But the street cars were not a concern.

The air-conditioning/heating vent was not noisy so crank the temperature up or down and you will not be bothered.

Be prepared to hear doors banging and occasional noises from the hallways. This was the one thing that I noticed during my stay. It could just be the room I stayed at, so this would be the only negative aspect.


Extras.

There is a roof-top pool that would be awesome during the summer months, sizeable but not long enough to do serious lap swimming.

Direct access to Shoeless Joe's Restaurant.

There is baggage storage for you to leave your bags - no charge.

Conclusion.

I would highly recommend The Radisson Queens Quay location as it ticks all the boxes of basic meets. The rate I stayed at was at a discount of $149/night excluding taxes and additional room-charges (as of September 4th, 2011), however, the regular rate was $189/night (as of September 4th, 2011). Still, for that price and for its unbeatable location of right being at the waterfront and Queens Quay, this hotel has HUGE value. Closest subway station is Union so this hotel is very close to all the major downtown hotspots if not for its close proximity to the subway and streetcar.

There is a small gift shop at the corner of the lobby, however for longer stays, there is a Shoppers Drug Mart and Rabba's Food Store directly across the street where you can purchase snacks and water. I would recommend this option so you don't have to pay hotel prices and you can just put the items in the fairly large fridge.

A definite stay for next time.

I'm not a breakfast person so I appreciate brunch or any place that serves breakfast alongside every other possible and feasible option so I'm not stuck eating what everyone else wants but I can't fathom.

YUE5S4ReiM4dq9qkKbDMwg,11,2014-06-12 04:49:45,9,BPRlCZ-Z_yRwWNe69V3zdA,"Why did I rate Joe's Crab Shack 3 stars when I rated In-N-Out Burger 4 stars in my last review? Interesting since Joe's Crab Shack is a casual dining restaurant that I get to visit once in awhile as a treat whereas In-N-Out Burger is a fast food establishment that I would normally dine in. The answer is employee enthusiasm. When I spend $6 in In-N-Out, the employees greet me with enthusiasm. However, when I spent $23 in Joe's Crab Shack you could kind of say the waitress was like a crab. The waitress wasn't nasty or bad at her job. She gave me the impression that she didn't want to be there. When I write reviews, I push on customer service and cheerful employees. Attitude could make or break my ratings.

  The fact that I was disappointed in the waitress's friendliness shouldn't have been. When I originally set foot in a Joe's Crab Shack in Orlando, Florida the restaurant was overflowing with a good times vibe. All the employees were friendly and at the top of the hour they'd dance. Enjoying an upbeat atmosphere over tasty seafood was my kind of scene. Joe's Crab Shack had a name for good times and seafood. It was a name that would draw me into a Joe's Crab Shack on vacation. When I moved to Las Vegas, the Henderson location lived up to the name. But in life things happened and Joe's Crab Shack disappeared from my life. On Sunday, when my brother and I were hanging out in Barnes & Noble, I was like, ""Joe's Crab Shack is a block away on Rainbow. Let's try it.""

  When we stepped foot in the restaurant,  which also sells gifts by the way; it was sparsely populated for a Sunday late afternoon. The hostess was friendly. If the waitress had had the hostess' s attitude this review would of taken a different tone.

  I ordered the Big Shrimp combo. The dish featured coconut shrimp, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab shrimp with fries and cole slaw. Over the years the menu must of changed. It wouldn't be surprising since the personality of Joe's Crab Shack had. Kind of like the waitress' s attitude, the Big Shrimp combo leaves me unenthusiastic. Why? Two of the three types of shrimp were breaded. Breaded shrimp reminds me of Mrs. Paul's. And I could just walk into aisle 2 of Walmart to pick it up. Now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious. The thing is it was tiny in proportion to the breaded shrimps and fries. In my honest opinion, Joe's Crab Shack would have been smart to follow Red Lobster's example of giving a choice of shrimps and less breaded shrimp. For the record, the fries and cole slaw was delicious. When all is said and done, the Big Shrimp Combo with a Coke and tip wasn't worth $23. 

   Dining out is precious. I work hard for my money and deserve to eat in a restaurant where the waitress wants to be. In reality, it will be at least 6 months until I patronize this location. Red Lobster, Bubba Gump, and lets face it In-N-Out Burger are better choices.",17,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w
DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw,2,2009-10-09 05:34:32,2,vPAh0oQMjuHZNozpb5OuKg,"L.A. people are so spoiled with wonderful sushi restaurants at nearly every corner - I'm one of those people. But I have to say that Roka Akor has blown most of the L.A. sushi restaurants I've been to out of the water. I don't always rate the restaurants I eat at for various reasons, but I couldn't wait to rate this restaurant. You'll see why...read on please.

Roka Akor is rated as one of the Top 10 sushi restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit, so with that rating plus being from L.A., we were definitely expecting a lot. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly at the best seat at the sushi bar, and given our menus. We took a gander, and were kind of shocked at the minimal selection of rolls on their menu. (Of course this didn't matter later once we tasted their food - everything is excellent. Don't let this disappoint you, it's excellent food.) A few minutes later, I noticed another couple seated a few seats away from us. Their waitress attended to them right away, and we still hadn't been attended to at that point, so I was immediately pissed off and ready to walk out of the restaurant. My friends who know me well, know that this action would have been true to form. I'm nice, but I'm accustomed to excellent service at all types of establishments. When I don't get it, I get pissed off - that's just who I am and I don't think I'm the only one.

I digress...

I'm glad my husband kept me seated to give the waiter a chance to come over and take our order because I ended up really enjoying myself...and the food obviously. We had a sampler of Shochu drinks, which are these delicious infused drinks. Our favorite was the Fuji Apple flavor, although all of them were good. At the same time we were served our appetizer - the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus yuzu. (Incidentally, the Fuji Apple Shochu really brought out the flavors of the Butterfish Tataki.) Usually butterfish has a muddled flavor - I think that's just the nature of that fish, but their preparation of this fish really cleaned it up. It exploded with flavor - very delicious.

We also ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chili Maki. This roll has very clean flavors - I enjoyed it very much. Next came the Roka Sushi selection, which are 4 different types of sushi selected by the chef. My only qualm here is that one of the four nigiri given was something we also had a full order of (the Salmon Goma Nigiri). Nonetheless, all of it was good. After that came the full order of Salmon Goma nigiri we ordered, which was sooooooo SO good. My husband usually doesn't like salmon because he thinks it's too fishy, while I ordinarily love salmon. We both loved loved loved this. It was so excellent. I would definitely order it again. Finally, we received the kobe beef, which was also very good. Perfectly cooked medium rare and lots of flavor. It comes with mushrooms which added a great dynamic flavor to the meat, and this yummy creamy sauce in which to dip the meat. Delicious. For dessert, we had the Green Tea Custard. We ordered this mostly out of curiosity. Who's ever heard of a Green Tea flavored custard? It did not disappoint. Light & airy, this custard really impressed us. I only wish I had the black cod because it looked so yummy and other yelpers have raved about it, but oh well. Maybe next time.

After the meal, our server apologized for the delay we experienced earlier in the evening. I really appreciated and respected that. It was definitely a good move on his part, and he got a good tip out of it. Later, though, I thought that if they were really sorry they could have comp'd part of our meal. So here's how I came up with the score:

5 for the food, knowledgeable wait staff and nice ambiance
minus 2 for the huge f*ck up early in the evening
plus 2 for the apology
minus 1 for not comping part of our meal
= 4 (if we could rate in half points, I'd probably give them 3 1/2)

Final thought: I don't know why we didn't get approached by the wait staff as quickly as the other couple who was seated after us, but I don't believe that people should keep quiet about stuff like that. When you pay for anything at any amount, you should be given the best service possible and if not, the establishments should expect to deal with the consequences for their actions. So, keep it up Yelpers! Use your consumer power!!",4,tm65SQadWCPaVyPMhqdEFQ

The bad - Very expensive for Arizona, cheap appliances that seemed to always have some issues, tiny washers and dryers, toilets that don't properly flush (I had maintenance out on several occasions but they could never fix this), lots of road noise from Camelback

The worst part of my whole experience living at the Optima is definitely dealing with the management.  I move into a brand new 2 bedroom unit expecting it to be spotless when it is in fact covered in drywall dust from the construction.  They sent some cleaners the next day but at that point I had already moved my stuff in and then had to spend part of a day still cleaning.  Not a good experience to start out.  For the first few months there seemed to be new management staff in the office about every week.  The package pickup was very unorganized for a while until they finally got some stability in the office.  What really upset me were the charges after I moved out.  They stick everyone with about a $500 cleaning and repair bill regardless if the unit needs it.  I tried to dispute the carpet cleaning charge but the office would not return my phone calls or respond to my emails.  Finally I get a notice a couple months later that it's going to be sent to collections.  I call the office to discuss and the person I talked to was completely clueless and said just to pay the bill.  I settle up everything except the $200 and they did finally send it to collections.  It was more about the principle of the situation and being bullied by the Optima management to pay whatever made up move out fees they make up.  I thought they would let the $200 go after I dropped over $36K in rent and moved into a filthy apartment.  Definitely the worst management staff I've dealt with!

Update - So I paid off the balance with the collections company in order to hopefully get this taken off my credit report. They said I would I would have to have Optima remove it so I took the receipt to the office and spoke with Denise Gable (Operations Manager). She informed me that they would not delete it even though I paid the balance. I explained that this killed my credit score and I was unable to qualify for a mortgage and she still refused to remove it. I then had to resort to hiring an attorney to get it removed!

JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA,1,2014-03-20 10:53:17,0,QNaH1yWJLc7rbxGjiuDzSQ,"Came here for Goyemon's 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event. They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. 

Upon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original ""promised"" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? 

SO ANYWAY.....

When our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been ""Said"" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! 

With that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. 

Ordered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. 

Blue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. 

Wagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and ""broken"" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The ""carrot?"" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. 

Foie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. 

Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to ""Savor"" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! 

Amaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice ""bite"" texture. fresh. 

Uni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. 

Overall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint.",1,Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g

I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.

First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.

About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla. 

Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4. 

My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.

This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50.",3,lvzVuPBCjPDgJS8AmBpaDg

I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.

In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6. 

I am one of those who misses the tastes offered by Istanbul Grill. Istanbul Grill was offering the similar gyro sandwich & fries even for more: $9. But, I was enjoying fully what I was eating: Their bread, gyro, and even fries, I mean every bite in the package was full with its own flavor and taste. 

It is very clear that the previous chief is not there any longer. Where is that chief now? If anyone knows, please write it here.

If you want to make it a casual blue ribbon title, then and hand out paper napkins, then you need to charge blue ribbon strip mall prices!  Yes, paper napkins!  I mean sushi can get messy and you just have this one paper napkin but you're buying cut rolls that cost $28 or higher, for like 4 pieces. $28 for the most basic roll in existence, a caterpillar roll!  I mean i would get it if it had toro in it but it was basic ingredients.  When I asked the manager about the situation with the napkins he said they have been ""considering it"" and brought me over some linen napkins which was really nice of him.  He said it's becasue they are trying to create a fun non stuffy casual atmosphere. But even fun people eating a nice expensive dinner before going clubbing would appreciate a clean, neat and comfortable dining experience.  Especially if you expect us to drop a couple of benjamins here.  

The sushi was seriously just OK, nothing amazing or memorable. I've had way better at hole in the wall sushi joints in California, but they've got Nobu egos here when creating the prices. 

The two stars are for our nice, patient and helpful server. He was great.  When all was said and done, our bill was over $250 for two people.

aFMBWYEk8PHyGuAiB6EeJw,0,2017-10-15 06:51:28,0,NINo9eYMnaABrVXztlFiPw,"We just got back from here tonight and we couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had!

I'm 29 and my SO is 32. We've been attending haunted Halloween attractions annually since we were in elementary school, and we've been to different ones in different parts of the country. We've been to really disappointing attractions and really mind-blowing ones. We're not people who scare easily, but we love horror-related anything and have to check it all out.

Here's why we loved The Crypt:

-It's a GOOD deal! It's $25 for 3 attractions. It wasn't super crowded and we maybe waited 15 minutes max at one of the lines. I realize this could change but I wouldn't recommend getting the fast passes because $25 was definitely a deal and cheaper than other Halloween attractions in the area. Oh and parking is free! (It's in the parking lot of Mesa Community College.)

-There are THREE attractions!
One is The Asylum, which has trick doors where you can get lost. Has a medical motif, but still mixed it up with some other creepy themes. Asylum was definitely our favorite.
Then there's Chaos, which is a clown-themed maze, and you have no idea where to go or what's going to appear in front (or behind) you.
And there's The Crypt. It was kind of a smorgasbord of themes that didn't fit into the other two. It was paced really well-- you didn't feel hurried or pushed through and spent time enough to feel a little uneasy and pursued.
Cheap thrills and jumps, and some were genuinely creepy. They got us a number of times and we left each one laughing our a$$es off being chased by an actor.

-The actors were passionate! Plenty made us genuinely laugh and a good number creeped us out. I was surprised since we went a little later in the night that they still were high energy and clearly going out of their way to give us a good experience. We couldn't stop commenting to each other about a few actors that really stood out to us.

-Like I mentioned above, short lines, wait times weren't bad at all.

-They ensure that you only go into each attraction with a small group. This is important because going in large groups has definitely ruined our experiences at other attractions in past years.

-There were all different age groups in attendance to the attractions and it looked like everyone was having a great time. I'd say the largest age group was 20s-30s.

-The overall attraction is more intimate and not oversaturated, and I feel like that makes it more desirable. We chose this over 13th Floor and Fear Farm because we know the lines at those places were going to be long, the tickets more expensive, and the actors are going to be tired out, and the groups you'll go through the houses with will be big. So we went to The Crypt instead and we did not regret it.

Definitely recommend this place for a night out that you won't regret :)",3,_vqBErKDBU6_6GJHFUE0yQ

I was stuck here on a layover to Florida. Landed at 9pm and was hoping to find some food to hold me over until my red-eye took off. To my surprise, nothing in my terminal was open. At 9pm? Are you kidding me. The only available food came from the duty free shops in other words cold sandwiches and a bunch of processed snacks. 

The terminal was outdated and dirty. Someone puked a few feet away from me while I was charging my phone in one of the lounge areas and it took over an hour for someone to come by and clean it up. The smell spread, I moved away to avoid the smell, but I could still smell it. 

I tried to take a nap since my flight wasn't until midnight, but the seats were uncomfortable and it was too packed for that.

Finally, I'm about to board and leave this horrible place, but the ticket scanner is out of service and they have to do this the caveman way. The process was so slow. I was ready to board my plane and get as far from Phoenix as possible.

faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,7,2015-07-08 22:26:00,4,44tGjOU0unV124BplkQfYw,"When Yardbird opened up earlier this year, I was dying to get in there and eat. For whatever reason, it took a few months us to finally go, but it was my birthday, and as good of as a reason as ever. We just recently went again for the second time for a friends birthday, and Yardbird has definitely solidified itself as one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.

A quick tip for those coming in for the first time. I think it's a lot easier to come into the The Palazzo parking garage off Spring Mountain. When you park, there's elevators that take you right up into the casino, then a short walk through the area with the big fountain, and Yardbird is right there. For me, that garage seems a lot easier to access, and it's almost never full either.

Anyhow, the restaurant itself is pretty cool. A bit smaller than you would expect, but we recently found out they have a little private dining area as well. It, like the rest of the restaurant has a lot of homey, classic southern style decor. Lots of wood, old pictures, and the private room has a wall full of liquors and a view of the wine cellar. They also have a nice section of the wall with a hidden TV that rotates pictures of musicians. If you have a large party to eat with here, definitely ask if that room is available. It makes for an even more enjoyable experience.

Now, the menu at Yardbird is pretty stout. It might seem small at first glance, especially since only one page is dedicated to food...but there's a lot of options, and the portions are huge. Their food is meant to be shared, so order up and have at it family style. 

So far, we've only been for brunch, but I think we've had just about everything on that menu besides the salads. Out of the 5 starter small plates, the only thing we haven't tried is the pork, but everything else is spectacular. Stand outs for me are the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Mama's Chicken Biscuits. Both on the pricey side at $14, but worth every cent. And that's not to take away from the Deviled Egg's or Chicken Liver Toast either, which are equally impressive, and even quite a bit cheaper.

Moving on to the main dishes, you can't not mention the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Yes, it's $36...but if you're idea of eating good involves chain restaurants and fast food, you shouldn't be here anyway. Not to mention, it easily serves 3 or 4 people, maybe more depending on what else you order. The chicken is absolutely amazing. Crispy, crunchy, but still tender and juicy. Their cheddar cheese waffles are unbelievable, and they serve them with this green tomato pepper jam stuff that ties everything in for a taste bud party. And I'm not even a watermelon fan...at all...but I enjoy their spiced watermelon served alongside it as well. 

The Shrimp n' Grits is another stand out for main dishes. A large bowl of creamy grits, topped with large, juicy shrimp, and little crispy bits of ham make for an excellent breakfast. It's another higher cost plate at $28, but even it can be shared with at least 2 people no problem.

A lot of there smaller items off their ""Odds and Ends"" menu are great too. First time visits, I'd suggest ordering the Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. And when you're done with all that, look right over to the right for dessert items. Since I've never had something there I didn't like, I'd say go for it all. The Mini Bacon Doughnuts, Chess Pie, Hickory Smoked Chocolate Coffee Cake and Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies are all excellent choices. 

My one and only biggest gripe with Yardbird is not so much the service itself, as it's almost always excellent, but both times we've been here, they have forgotten dishes. Our first time here, they completely left out an order of Deviled Eggs. This past visit they forgot to bring out an order of Shrimp n' Grits, so one of our party had to exit the room and go ask for it. Then when it came time to order dessert, they completely forgot an order of the bread budding. Luckily we were all pretty much at breaking point, but it's irritating to say the least. Especially when this place specializes on family style eating and having guests order multiple plates. To be honest, I'm not even 100% sure if we paid for the missing items on either visit either. 

When all is said and done though, Yardbird is seriously one of the most enjoyable and memorable places to eat. It's not crazy expensive for what you get, and if you come with a group of people, the experience is even that much better, and your bill will be cheaper to split. On both occasions we've spent close to $300, but that's for big parties of 8 or more, and with tip. There's not many places you can spend about $30-$40 per person while getting that much food and being able to sample that many items. 

Trust me, the bird is the word.",8,QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ

Hands down the best Deli in Las Vegas, and one of the best in the Western United States.  The Reuben here is legendary. Understated on the menu, but good luck on finishing it'! Do yourself a favor--  don't delve into researching it too much, Carnegie's take on the Reuben is exaggerated, excessive, extra ordinary, over blown, and over executed, it's a masterpiece. Let it be a surprise. 

My gripe would be the turkey they serve here. It's above average, but it pales in comparison to the outstanding corned beef and pastram, which is as superior as any in the country. 

The diner style dishes are prepared fresh, things like Meat Loaf, fried chicken, open faced burgers are superb. 

Breakfast is excellent, and reminiscent of what you'd find at any great Manhattan deli.

Just a couple gripes. I don't like the set up here. Once you enter, you think the line is its normal length from the one end of the room to the entrance, just like the other location. Instead, there is no line to place your order. You go straight to the cashier surpassing the long length of people who already paid, but just waiting to be called up for their order to be made. 

I felt stuck, even though I'm sure I could have asked for a refund if I wanted. As opposed to just leaving a line once your impatience bell rings lol. I also didn't like how our 4 separate orders were made in 3 different sections by different people. It was hard to keep up with my kids who each wanted to watch their ice creams being made. 

I like Summerlin's set up where you stand in line and wait to be helped. You place your order with your one guy, and they take care of the whole thing for you, then you pay at the end. Prices are just a little more at this location. There's a loud and pretty obnoxious worker at this location that swore he was a Japanese teppanyaki/hibachi worker. Too boasty but as I watched, he wasted his energy more on his trying to interact and entertain than making the Rolled ice cream to the ""Rolled ice cream"" standard. His rolls kept falling apart.

We gotta show love to Benecio and Shakira though. Benecio went straight into it and perfected my rolls of ice cream. My husband was in disbelief with how good Shakira's rolls were too lol. We'll definitely be back, maybe when it's less busy. I'm hoping they can change their set up to be like Summerlin's.

We're renting a three bedroom and can't even use the one of the rooms bc of water leakage. Calling Cynthia does nothing! Their handyman shows up drunk and can't fix anything right. He just does quick fixes and we're still having the same problem. Now they're saying we haven't renewed our lease since 2013!!! 

Take note and DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! 
 
Sending in a complaint to the real estate board. Let's see how they like that!



This is so frustrating! My husband went to talk to Cynthia. The handyman they continue to send out is her husband. He has shown up drunk. He admitted to not knowing how to fix the roof and ceiling. When my husband told her this, she started yelling at him, saying he does know how to f*#!'ing fix it. Mind you, he was in his uniform! At that point he walked out and called professional standards at the real estate board. Talking to them, they were absolutely appalled at them. I had to call my dad, his name is on the lease still. He called Tami- she is not a licensed realtor- and told her what was going on. My dad is currently battling cancer again. She told him that she would take care of this for him. That they would be sending out a professional roofing company out to fix the problem. This was on 04/12/16. She also asked my dad to ask us not to send in the complaint to the board. 


10 days go by and I had not heard anything. It started to rain again so I call Tami. I asked her what was going on with the roofer. She puts me on speaker phone to talk to Cynthia about it. I don't see why she had to talk to her when she assured my dad that she would take care of this. I remind her of that, so she yells at me that, that's not her job and she never said that. By now I am pretty irate over this situation. I yelled back at her saying this is disgusting the way they treat their tenants and no one should have to deal with this. I also told her that was going to send in the complaint finally since they do not want to fix this problem. All she said was do what you have to do. Not once has she said sorry, or I'll do what I can, or anything that was helpful. 

I immediately call the board. 

04/25/16 Jan from the board calls me back. Gives me some instructions on what my options are. Apologizes for what we have to go through. 

04/25/16 a roofer comes at 0730. He works for KB Homes. Finally a pro! He climbs on the roof and tells my husband that he was scared up there. The roof is closing to collapsing!! He comes inside to take pictures. Wes their shoddy repair work in my daughters room. Even he is appalled!! Tells us that he will get his crew out next week. 

04/29/16 my husband pays rent. Speaks to Tim. Asks to speak to their broker to make him aware of his employees and their attitudes. Tim gives my husband a card for their ""broker"" but the card just says he's another realtor. 

My dad calls me saying this company wants to look at the roof. We Google to number and it comes up with the name Cynthia. Why a diff company?

   The teriyaki chicken was excellent. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious.  My husband's lemon chicken was amazing! I wanted to keep stealing bites. Their curry chicken is just right. Not overwhelmingly spicy, seasonings just right. This was my 1 year old's favorite dish.

As soon as we walk in the door we were greeted, which is awesome, I love customer service. 
I did not expect the inside to be modern and set up nicely since it was a new sushi burrito joint that I never heard of. Also the wall in the dining area was decorated with neat drawing instructions on how to order and above the workers station/cashier was a nice 3 screen menu. As you can tell the owner had this nicely planned out and put a lot of money into this business. The male worker recommended the most popular ones, (we ordered the #1 which is the sashimi oishi priced at $10.95) he was very polite and was open to any questions. 
My girlfriend got hers as the bowl and I got mine as a burrito. So just to break it down the burrito

Size: Decently sized burrito compared to others

Taste: delicious, sashimi was fresh and the rice was not to sticky or dry. 

Price: $10.95 which isn't bad since that's what everyone in town pretty much charges

As for the bowl it was a generous size, although they made a mistake and gave my girlfriend a very vinegary rice, which they brought up to her as they found out themselves they made a vinegary rice batch. They offered to redo her bowl for her which was nice. 

The only thing I don't really like about this place is that they need a fountain drink machine, it bugs me when restaurants have only canned soda options. Also they might need some type of Japanese sweet desserts or pastries to finish off after a meal.

Overall I would most likely come back to this place if I am in need of a sushi fix.",0,nsMPCcO4k8ZtaaBt4F5a-Q

Dr. Street's philosophy is totally and completely ANTI forceful manipulation... he believes in a more holistic approach to maximize sustained long term relief and let the body adjust as it should (over time and NOT by brute force)... she must have the wrong guy?!?

I initially bought a Groupon to go see Dr. Street mid last year. I've been to chiropractors in the past and been unimpressed. So, my first visit here, I was a total skeptic. I walked in, Groupon in hand, thinking ""ehh, this is a waste, but hey it was cheap and I was going to be in the area, so whatever."" I was so wrong!

I felt so much better after just a few visits that I gave one of the longer term packages a try. Dr. Street explained the entire process (for instance, there are a few 'downs' while your body adjusts to new positioning). I knew what to expect, ups and downs, and he was dead on every step of the way!

It's taken time and commitment, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER than I have in the past. I thought the constant aches and pains were just kind of how it went. I feel better than I have in years, and Dr. Street's is the only care I've received. It's all because of him.

I have a CRAZY hectic schedule - do you know how many times poor Dr. Street has stayed late, once in a while until after 6 PM, patiently waiting for me? And how many times I've rescheduled on an hours' notice? I do this continually... I hate doing it, but I'm married to my job and that's my hectic life. I love Dr Street because, in addition to alleviating my pain, he's JUST A WONDERFUL PERSON! He's patient, approachable, understanding, and puts up with my crazy sort of schedule with a smile... because he's a wonderful, happy guy who actually truly cares about your well-being. They don't make people like that any more!

After I mangaged to choke that down, I tried the amber ale. The color was pretty good, so I was hoping this would be better. NEGATIVE. It had no aroma, and when I went to taste it, it tasted just like the pilsner. I had my girlfriend try both the beers too, she also agreed with me.

However, the food and service here just didn't do it for me. 

My friend was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner and drinks. We arrived pretty early and there were plenty of open tables but apparently you need a reservation to get a table...no problem so we just sat at the bar. 

The drink menu is not extensive but they have a full bar and a decent selection of martinis. I ordered the Bikini Martini. It was good, not great. It's a mix of pineapple, coconut and grenadine...sounds super yummy. But it was not...(that's just my opinion) I finished it but I would not order it again. 

For the meal, I went with the chicken, spinach and mascarpone ravioli. I ordered the small portion thinking it would be more than enough but I was mistaken. The plate came out with three pieces of ravioli in the parmesan cream sauce sauce. I didn't enjoy it. And I was really underwhelmed with the presentation and after a few bites it was back to Yelp to search for another spot to eat because I was still really hungry. 

Also the service was lacking. It wasn't that busy but after we ordered there were a few other guest that came in and ordered and got their food before we did...what's up with that?!? 

As we were wrapping up we felt rushed along...apparently there was an event there later that evening that they were setting up for...So it just seemed like we were in the way. Ugh.

A family run business where the husband is front of house and the wife and another chef do the cooking. The food is prepared with pride and love and was delicious. For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! 
We ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish.

My friend and I are on a quest to find the best tuna tartar in the valley....why?  Well, why not, I guess!  She'd googled something like ""best tuna tartar"" and City Hall came up in her search.  So sad it did because I wish I had my time and money back.  They need to send someone over to The Mint to see how tuna tartar should be made!  The price for the tuna tartar was $18 which I'd HAPPILY pay if it was GOOD but it was awful!  Instead of a nice bowl of tender delicious tuna like we had at The Mint, we got a tri-level blob on our plate.  The bottom layer was what I believe were crushed up chow mein noodles of some sort....bland and boring!  The next layer, which was about 3/4 of the blob, was guacamole....WEIRD!  And it wasn't even a nice bold flavorful guac!  Like the chow mein noodles, it was bland and boring.  Then in a VERY thin layer smeared on the top were some small pieces of raw tuna.  And guess what?  It was bland and boring too!  No surprise there, huh?  So we very disappointed to say the least.  We also opted to try the seared ahi tuna.  Another mistake!  I've eaten a LOT of ahi in my life (Salt Cellar always has beautiful ahi!!) and when I order seared ahi, I expect it to be put on a very hot grill for just a moment and then turned over for another moment and then off so that the inside is still nice and raw.  Everywhere I've had seared ahi from one side of the US to the other has been prepared that way.  At City Hall it was cooked all the way through and it really ruined it for me.  It almost seemed as if we were eating canned tuna.  Not impressed!  We would have complained to our server if we ever saw her!  I was finally able to flag her down and get our bill but by then, we didn't have time to say anything as we needed to leave.  Kudos to the valet at least!

Not Canes! 

Best "" strip club"" around!  Premium, juicy breast to give Spearmint Rhino some envy. Something wrong with you if you don't check out those breasts and not lick yo lips. 

I've been back with the BF for some BFG love and back with my Yelperazzi family. Something simple sometimes is the best food. Goooooo Tin! Please keep feeding us nomlicious strips (Gotta slap some Yelpers for not giving enough love to the guy in the kitchen). 

I tried something different with the Yelpizzles and got the bibimbap special ($5.25). It was pretty solid with a variety of fresh and crisp veggies and nicely marinated chicken with a perfectly fried egg. 

Apparently there are four weekly specials on rotation: bibimbap, teriyaki bowl, hot chick sandwich, and chicken nachos. I will update as I try the other 3 specials, salad, and baked chicken.

I already have a favorite down though- crispy strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and sweet chili.

Did the tasting menu. Overall my palettes were confused, too many flavors competing with each other. I love savory food, but this was overkill.

- Dark Stormy Night: Rum with Ginger Beer: Not a huge fan of ginger, but this tasted just right.
- Gazpacho soup: compliments of chef. Felt like I should have bit into a fresh onion
- Bread: sourdough that was very hard and bacon roll
- Beef Tartare: the egg yolk made this dish creamy and yummy
- Pear salad with shaved brussel sprouts and macadamia nuts: This dish could have used more pears. The sprouts were bitter, and the salt was heavy handed. Again more bacon
- Rabbit wrapped in BACON: Noticing a theme here? This dish was actually pretty tasty. Hate to say it but it did taste like chicken. 
- Seared scallops with braised beef: not too bad, I finished this entire dish
- Beef belly: very fatty, which is the idea of this dish, but after one bite I had had enough. Way too rich
- Crispy Pork: very tender
- Soaked pear (not sure in what) with truffle ice cream - Pear was good, didn't care for the truffle ice cream

Who would have thought at the age of 12 you would be  concerned  with style and clothing. I now realize that clothes mean everything when you're a teenage, boy or girl. 

Fortunately, today there are a lot of options for teens. There are so many popular stores that cater to a younger demographic making it easy to find clothes.

Over the weekend, I took my nephew clothes shopping.  I mentioned about a dozen different stores, all of which  he responded with a head nod.  My nephew asked if we could go to Tilly's.  I have never heard of Tilly's, but thought it was worth a try. 

 I was pleasantly surprised as we walked into.  Tilly's offers men's clothing, women's clothing, kids' clothing, backpacks, shoes and accessories from all the popular brands.

The staff at Tillys  is helpful, accommodating, and they take their time helping you find exactly what you are looking for.  The prices are reasonable and a selection is large.

However, I would suggest settling yourself down in the FS pool since they help you find a seat, cover your chair, bring you water and occasionally they bring little complimentary treats out to the pool goers. Plus it doesn't feel nearly as crazy busy as the Mandalay pools. I would definitely stay here during the summers.

This was my first time ever visiting a red lobster. I grew up on the coast, so when we wanted seafood red lobster was never a place that came to mind. That is until they announced their endless shrimp promotion! I love shrimp, so I figured if there was ever a good time to give red lobster a try this would be it. The service was pretty standard and comparable to any big chain restaurant, not outstanding but good. Now I can't comment on some of the other food they offer at red lobster but that endless shrimp promotion was amazing! They start you off with biscuits and a side salad. Then the entrée is any two types of shrimp and two sides. Now, at this point I was pretty full but being the shrimp lover that I am I had to keep muscling down more. Every few minutes our server would come over and ask what we wanted to try next and as advertised, the shrimp were endless they just kept bringing out more.  At the end of the meal, we had three boxes of leftover food to bring home! If stuffing your face like this wasn't such a health hazard, I would be there every night.",1,x8e1Cc1lh835Q1CpHAD0RQ

At first I was all excited to look at puppies and possibly gain another family member.  My husband and I were looking at all the puppies and noticed that they all seemed so calm and sleepy. I just wanted to give this company the benefit of the doubt and thought so many people played with them and since they are puppies they may be all tuckered out.

My husband then got a text message, and like any other human being with a phone, he decided to read it and text back.  Then the male employee approached him and told him that there is no pictures, videos, or Facebook allowed of the animals.  First of all it doesn't say that anywhere in the store. And second of all, it made me think that they may be doing something illegal or unethical...

AMAZING to say the least; I'm truly blessed and honored to have his talent on permanent display. I followed him all the way from Los Angeles and I came to know the nicest, most professional shop I've ever come across. I am considered a tattoo collector and have work from some of the most renowned names in the industry, from some of the world famous shops, particularly from Los Angeles. In all honesty, Skin Design Tattoos is the premier shop. It sets the bar so high that no other shop can touch it. In terms of professionalism, they define excellence. From the appointment setting process, the deposit taking, the reminders via email and text, to the after care follow up instructions (Mario you're the man!)  they know what they are doing and they are doing it right! The artists that are all here are experts in their respective fields and talents whether it be color (Vic Vivid), portraits and black and gray (Robert Pho/Andy Pho/Fernie Andrade) or custom lettering (David Ruiz), they have every aspect covered...up to and including cleaning up and removing unwanted work with their tattoo removal service (Anthony). 

I without hesitation and with the utmost pride and honor highly recommend you give Skin Design Tattoos your business when you decide you want to get that permanent ink. The saying goes, ""A good tattoo isn't cheap and a cheap tattoo isn't good"" rings truer now than ever. Invest wisely and you will never reap regret!

Choose between A/C or furnace unit checkup). (NOT NEEDED) 

Made the appointment and two men came to my home I notice something wrong was the 'cleaner device': It was rather small with medium sucking power. What amazed me was the fact that this machine was put in only ONE ROOM vent - the kitchen. It was there quite along time but - how can one vent - clean all vents in the house? it didn't have enough sucking power to get the 'dust' from any duct or vent.

After mentioning to them, they disregarded my opinion, saying that 'this is the way its' done. No race intended - this Hispanic gentlemen worked the whole time they were here - but on the one air duct. However, the causation man just walked around. 

He did turn the temperature for air flow. He did remove a vent or two but no cleaning - as stated in coupon. I got concerned since I did not see him doing anything. Went into the utility room and he was standing there - I asked about the dryer vent ? And he said it was done LIE. I thought how could he do it when he did not move the dryer ? -Dryer top was totally full of things. a reliable contractor returned and told me THIS WAS NOT DONE.

After getting down from the ladder - the wanderer proceeded to show me a picture on his phone of dirty ducts - and said they were mine UPSALE Furthermore, he said I needed DEEP CLEANING at a cost of $200 a duct - recently had these inspected so this was a lie - somebody else ducts in the picture

. I had the choice of a furnace or A/C inspection. I said I have a contract with an excellent service company - the wanderer - insisted he look at it - but put my foot my foot down. UPSALE - the wanderer said they had an air filter unit they could sell me. I showed him my unit and said it was the best in the business - when I purchased my unit i was given a comparison of others on the market - none of this was provided. -

It's located in a plaza where there are a bunch of eateries. There is also a DriveTest office, which makes me cringe to be entering a parking lot full of worried wannabe licensed drivers.

We went in and were immediately greeted by a number of Chinese folks. It is a cheerful Cantonese-speaking group.

I ordered the chicken bowl, which consists of rice and beans, and any fresh toppings that you desire. Naturally, I needed corn, but also added other goodies. I went with the chipotle sauce. It has a slight kick to it. I also ordered a cream soda.

If you want guacamole, it is an extra $2. The place also sells beer. Seating is limited.

Since were were the largest group there, our meals were brought to us. It was a nice touch.

I enjoyed my chicken bowl. All ingredients were fresh and tasty.

Our group was mixed as far as opinions go. My manager and another colleague weren't impressed. They have been to a number of burrito places and probably have higher expectations than the rest of us. The rest of us found our meals to be tasty.

This place has a card stamp program. If you order ten times, your next order is free. I will need to look at my card more carefully, as I have yet to read the fine print. I will definitely come back here and figure it out.

Worth the 20 minute wait in the sun, with the Virgin mobile tent blasting the latest whatever in my ear, especially when they called my name and I opened the brown Naaco box to reveal chickpea fritters wrapped in a gluten free pita and a generous helping of mogo chips (cassava chips, I think?). I dusted some citrus salt on there and dug in. It was filling without being heavy, the fritters were crunchy on the outside, soft inside and the toppings were really fresh. They were out of iced tea but we did get a s'moresa for dessert, a samosa filled with callebaut chocolate and chai spice, which was delicious, covering our faces with powered sugar.

Sloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.

We all had salads for our first course:
 - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.
 - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.
 - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.
 - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.

As for mains:
 - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.
 - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.
 - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.
 - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.

Sides:
 - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!
 - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)
 - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.

Desserts:
 - Ice cream - not much to say about that
 - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich
 - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.

For the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.

All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

All-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service.",1,Bjz4TBIlyv6SBvYf5IOHBA

Go to Big Jimmy's if you want a five dollar pizza.
Coming back from a bar on the light rail, my boyfriend and I noticed the ""$5 PIZZA!"" sign hanging in front of this restaurant.  I was drunk and had the munchies hardcore, so we decided to get off the train and walk over.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  It was a cheap hole in the wall pizza place, right next to Food City.
Surprisingly, I found the pizza to be pretty frickin' delicious!  The sausage had wonderful flavor, the cheese seemed like REAL cheese (unlike that weird yellowish stuff on Little Caesars pizza ;] ) and there was just the right amount of tasty sauce.  The free seasoned crust was better than Hungry Howie's.   Actually, the entire pizza was better than a Hungry Howie's Pizza.  And we all know where Little Caesar's sits on the totem pole, so of course it was better than any Little Caesar's pizza also.
""Am I just drunk or is this actually really good?""  I asked my boyfriend at one point.  He replied, ""no, this is actually pretty damn good.""  I had my suspicions, however. I recall one drunken night, I even found Gus's Pizza to be tasty.  I know, I know.  I had a lot to drink that night...
The next morning my suspicions were cleared.  We heated up the leftovers and ate them and the pizza was still super tasty.
I have been back several times since, and have been itching to try their other menu items such as the wings and sandwiches.  This is the best place by ASU campus to get $5 pizza.  Actually, since I discovered it, I haven't ordered pizza from ANYWHERE else, so I can actually say this is one of the best places to get pizza in the Tempe area.",8,cQVehKDqaypSITyzpKPdYQ

But I was happily proven quite wrong! Peppercorns, a jewel of a restaurant tucked on a busy corner and backing onto a peaceful lagoon, was the discovery of the year! When traveling as a single woman and asking for a 'table for one', I often feel a distinct chlll from the server or from the maître'd, as if  wondering if it's even worth their time to wait on this poor lonely waif.  This was not the case at Peppercorns. I was welcomed and offered a premier table overlooking the  water.  Once I ordered wine, the mood of the  server improved and the rest of the evening was a delight.  A fine Caesar salad began the courses and it was as fresh as I have ever had.  I couldn't resist the 'Braised Angus Short  ribs in Guinness Stout' and I did not regret my choice!  Succulent, tender, flavorful and accented with silky mashed potatoes and fresh baby vegetables, this was a dish that I will not soon forget!  Amazingly, I was offered a 'complementary' dessert at meal's end.  How good can it be, I thought?  But the maple flavored chocolate cake that arrived provided the perfect meal's end and if I weren't such a lady, would have prompted a good plate-licking.  At the close of the evening, the gracious restaurant owner (who had been on the floor all evening pouring water, changing linens) thanked me for my business.

Anything to avoid that whole talking-to-a-real-person thing.

Anytime I try a new Chinese place I order all of my favorites at once just so I know if it's worth a second time around.

There were some highs and lows and in-betweens.

1. Wonton Egg Drop Soup - Nothing on any Chinese menu will ever be better than putting the two best soups in the world together.... unless you get it from Gold Chef.  I'm glad I only ordered the small because I didn't even finish that.  The wontons were fine, but the broth was so bland.  It was basically just egg water... I want you to sit and think about what egg water might taste like... you got a lock down in your mind on that? That's right.  Egg water.  It was really, really horrible.  Zero stars for the soup.

2.  Crab Puffs - These were fine.  Not any detectable crab, but they weren't over sweet like so many tend to be.  I would order these again.  

3.  Egg Rolls - A few people mentioned that there is no meat in these, but there most certainly was a noticeable amount of pork in mine.  So please, if you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, this is NOT something you want to order.  Do not listen to the other reviews who say it's all vegetable.  That all being said, they are tasty.  Sufficiently crispy and flavorful with a good ratio of wrapper to filling.

4. Lemon Chicken - The chicken is breaded, not battered, which is a plus in my book.  The lemon sauce was also probably the best lemon sauce I've ever had.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, though.  It's very sweet and tastes almost like a lemon glaze for pies rather than something for a savory dish, but I thought it tasted awesome with the chicken.  This is gonna be a judgment call on if you think you'd like a sweeter sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't as dry as the breaded chicken tends to be in other places, so that was a bonus as well.

5. Singapore Mei Fun - No one ever has and probably ever will beat the PF Changs version of this dish (Singapore Street Noodles) but this one was decent.  The chicken and pork seemed a little dry and not very fresh, but the flavor was fine and the shrimp was cooked well.  I might have liked it just a touch spicier though.

Overall, everything was very good, but I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 star rating because the soup was just THAT BAD.  The only way I'd order again is if I had a craving for something specific and didn't really want soup.  Sadly, I usually only order Chinese food when I have a soup craving specifically.  Such a shame that the most important component for me was the one horrible thing I got.",0,mi7aYUUbugSSxr5_Ytga-A

Prior to the renovation that was completed in 2013, it was pretty bad. Horrible beds, old carpet, furniture, etc...   The local clientele that frequents the place is a bit sketchy. We witness a stabbing one evening in Marilyn's Cafe. Most of the clientele, however is from out of town, but at these rates, you can imagine some of the people that stay there. My company has an annual conference there, so I don't really have a choice. The Italian restaurant downstairs, isn't bad and Marilyn's isn't bad for breakfast.  The bellmen are exceptional though.

The food presentation was stellar and I especially liked the fact that each serving was brought by a single waiter who, while carefully placing it in front of us, would whisper in our ear a description of what we were about to enjoy.  

Every bite was enjoyable and the desserts were just as good.  We ordered a bottle of wine and simply enjoyed a stellar meal.  My wife will tell you that one of the highlights was when they brought her a purse holder clip with ""Le Cirque"" written in rhinestones... of course her favorite part of the story is when they gifted it to her at the end of the meal.

But, my friend insisted it was a cool-looking spot and had tasty food, including veggie options, so I gave the Arcadia neighborhood restaurant a whirl and was pleased with my meal there.

Upon walking in, I was immediately impressed by the long, dark bar lit up by red lights. There's no host, but a bartender will direct you where to sit-at the bar, or in one of the comfy booths facing the bar. The restaurant is one long rectangle, which makes every seat in the house an intimate one because you don't have to hear chatter from other parties. The bar features sports televisions, and it's a hip place for casual occasions.

The menu, not surprisingly, is full of meat dishes, including hamburgers, a chicken wrap and a turkey burger. I opted for the grilled portobello sandwich ($10), which came with fried zucchini, ricotta salata and watercress. It was a massive burger and tasted great.

I added a side of mac and cheese ($6), which also tasted great but wasn't anything spectacular.


My pal got the equally massive peppercorn burger ($10), topped with charred onion, watercress and matchstick potatoes.

I shared his tasty fries ($4) with him.

While I thought The Grind was a little pricy, especially because burgers don't come with sides and my meal totaled $16, I think the atmosphere is sleek and trendy and worth it if you really want a nice burger place. Plus, the staff, including our bartender and server, was incredibly friendly.

At this station premium was $.50 more per gallon than regular!! I've never seen such a huge difference between the lowest grade and highest, that's crazy!

Sure enough, after an admirable experience with Buster's Sea Cove during the VELD Music Festival, I decided to go there again, especially after hearing great reviews.

I decided to get the grilled octopus after pressuring and recommendation from one of the employees. It came with either fries or salad (I went with caesar salad). I got about four BIG pieces of octopus on top of the caesar salad.

Portion wise I was definitely happy considering I paid a total of just over $18 with a drink, as I initially thought it would be a bit of a ripoff. In fact, I didn't even finish the salad, that's how filling it was. The octopus was definitely one of the best ones I've had ever, and it didn't even need to be fried, since fried stuff is usually tastier.

Me and my bob were craving some late night snack, so we decided to do pizza hut. My bob was wanting there buffalo wings, they looked so good on ther website. So we ordered some. Only$ 6.99 for 8 piece which is not bad,(plus the delivery fee is$ 3.50) so we just got those. 
I called them up and they guy picked up the phone, his name was jo, he sounded he wasn't even on earth when I was talking to him, I had to keep on repeating my order. Finally about the 3rd time I told him my order he said it will be here about 35 to 40 min. I thought it was kinda long for wings but I said ok. 
55 min later, I still haven't heard anything so I called Jo up again and I asked, what is keeping our order, he said wait just a little bit longer, it should be there, wait another 15 min, if he is not there, call us back. So I said ok, waited for actually 20 min, still nothing, so I called him back, I kept my cool and I asked what is going on, he said what is the address again I told him again, than he handed the phone to his manager, I talked to her and she told us that they called us couple times to let us know that we were at the house couple of times for our wings, I stood right by our door the whole time I didn't get any knock or anything. She got a  little bit pissy at me and said well, we will make a new batch, except us in 5 min, I said ok, I walked outside with my computer and waited, they were here in less that 4 min when I got off the phone.
The delivery guy told us he was sorry about all the trouble. Than he started asking us all kinds of questions about our living situation which was not perfectionall at all. 
I didn't really answer him, he was nice though. 
As I walked in the house and looked at the order, it was the wrong order, he they gave us boneless buffalo wings. I went threw all that for them to give me the wrong order, I will NOT be ordering from this pizza hut again, they are others around our area that I will try. I wish you luck at this pizza hut.

It wasn't anything like curry. They didn't even use coconut milk. It was just some chicken in some kind of gooey green sauce. It wasn't horrible, but not what I wanted.

I would say that the crust was a bit overlooked for my taste. It was quite crisp but not burnt. I felt like the sauce was non existent. I understand that garlic sauce is a light sauce, but I have had some great garlic sauces. Plus having only cheese, I should be able to taste garlic. Overall, bland. Now the Cleveland Burger - think a Roman Burger. I would venture they cook the burger in the pizza oven. The edges of the burgers are extremely crispy, yes, crispy. Even with the Italian dressing, cheese, tomato & lettuce, it still crunched when I bit into it. I would be a good sandwich if the burger was properly cooked. Sorry, I don't like crunchy burgers.

Though I was told the enchilada was spicy and filling, the burger was a huge disappointment. A small patty, equivalent to the size of a McDouble was provided to me, but came with no sides, and a severely undercooked patty. I'm all for having a medium rare beef patty on my burger, but this was just too rare for my liking and too expensive for what you get. On top of all this, their advertised ""tall boy special,"" where you get a $5 beer is completely false. We got a 355ml can of cheap beer for &5. Absolutely ridiculous.

Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.

Their sashimis were good... but not great.

Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests.

LA64v2QfwiIfiXixqnzClA,1,2014-10-29 14:42:59,0,a3XZZEHaCCCIEKSzKOO_pw,"I have been going to DiMaggio's for 9 years.  In that time I have had 4 different vehicles.  Tom, Sterling and Lonnie are as good as it gets.  If you have a Ford question ask for Sterling.  He is an absolute expert when it comes to Ford especially pickups.  Having an honest shop is very important.  I don't question Tom at all.

I recently purchased a 2001 Ford F250 as a project truck.  I knew it needed ball joints and I don't have the tool to do the work.  I took it to Sterling so he could look it over and make me a list of items.  He must have spent hours on the truck making me a two page list of things that needed to be done.  I had him replace the front ball joints, front brakes and the front drive shaft.  I figured since he already had it apart why not do the work.  I was amazed at how low the price was for the repair.  Tom was extremely fair with me and didn't charge me for Sterling giving it the once over.  I was so impressed I bought the shop lunch.

Tom will always have a list of things wrong with your vehicle.  He does this to help you out.  Most times people don't fix items until they break and are stranded.  Work with him.  Let his team make the list so you know what is wrong.  Ask what items need to be fixed right away and what items can wait.  I have done this with my wifes 2004 Ford Focus.  We have had repairs that we planned out and it took 6 months to complete based on the money we had available.  Tom is as honest as a person can be.  

Most people get frustrated when it comes to vehicle repairs because they don't know anything about vehicles.  I suggest to take it to DiMaggio's, let them make a list of what is wrong, then do a search on the internet to get educated on the repair.  You will soon see that they have the correct approach and you will feel more confident about the repair.",3,qRowyNE41mNDFKbo3letCg

The matcha is very strong and bitter which I did enjoy since I like tea flavoured food but warning for those who dont like bitter ice cream. They told us the black sesame soft serve tonight was apparently grittier than normal but we chose to go with it anyway and it tasted great to me. If I had to pick, black sesame wins over matcha all the way. Lack of comfy seats!

---

Five stars for the black sesame soft serve. Reminds me of the (much better than here) 7/11 everywhere in Japan serving the most awesome varieties of soft serve ice cream including black sesame. I would say its even better as there is a real sesame taste while still being creamy. 

Service was good, the guy asked if we wanted to try a sample of the hokkaido milk when we wondered what that flavour of milkshake would taste like. Not enough seats. Would be hard to stand outside when cold, but we didnt need to line up at all as we came an hour before they closed.

Will be back to try the matcha flavour... that is if I can resist the black sesame!",4,Hci2c0qo98CO-Pv-VmV7gg

Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd ""go and check on it"", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.  (Keep in mind, the lunch rush was pretty much over that day,  as I counted two tables on the patio, and perhaps two more inside with customers still eating.) So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.  We got up, walked out, and went over to Oregeno's across the street and proceeded to get top-rated service and food from these guys.  The reason Yelp is fabulous is you can have a head's up on what to expect at businesses. Just know what to expect here.",1,7srDZfonLndlSL9hdJpe8Q

No sitting in showrooms while the salespeople play the game of ""let me check with my manager"".  AAA had also given us access to low price financing that was useful to have when the dealership wanted you to use their financing....we'd say not unless you can beat the low rate from the AAA provider.  Moved to NC and used the AAA Carolinas site-what a disappointing difference!  On a Saturday afternoon, there was only 1 customer service person available to help with the process and at that, he didn't have access to the loan application or 2018 model cars yet.  What?  We went to the Sam's Club auto buying site and had much better luck using the same TrueCar system that AAA uses.

I went back in March with a friend who was getting a second lobe piercing and I myself got my navel pierced. I knew of friends who had gone there for piercings and it was very close to us so we figured hey, why not? 

We had Ana and she was just about the coolest person I've ever met. Something about her personality just makes you feel very reassured that she knows what she's doing. My friend has a huge fear of needles and I was very impressed that Ana saw that as completely valid (though my other friend and I were giving our friend a hard time about it) and did everything she could to make her feel at ease. 

Ana was meticulous about having the correct spacing between the first piercing and the second, and making the second piercings look even, and had me and my other friend check her work. I was very impressed, when I got my doubles at Claire's it was nowhere near as detail oriented, oops! 

Then came time for my belly button, and it was great!! I am so happy with the way it turned out, I love the jewelry I bought (not exactly cheap but worth the price to not get an infection from crappy metal) and Ana did an excellent job placing the piercing in the right spot. I paid about $120 total, $40 for the piercing and $68 for the jewelry, plus tax. There are cheaper jewelry options available, I just chose to go with a sterling silver curved bar with CZ stones at both ends, which I imagine is on the pricey side, though they did have yellow gold options available. 

On a scale of 1-10, the pain was probably a 4. I've had bruises that hurt more than that did! Ana even said that cartilage hurts more, which I can see. The nice thing too is the only time it ever hurt was during the actual piercing, once the jewelry was in I could barely even feel that it was there! 

Super cute and I got it with enough time to heal a bit before summer swim season. Ana was very strict about not swimming but I started swimming 2 months after with no problems. I even went to Panama and swam in rivers with god knows what living in it, and the ocean, but still no infection! I will say though that chlorine dries out the skin a lot and pools harbor a lot of bacteria so be sure to clean it after swimming. 

Halo is the best and I recommend it to everyone I know!! Everything is super clean and the whole process is a well oiled machine and you really feel like these people know what they are doing. If I decided I want any more piercings, I will definitely go back!! Oh, and for all you teenagers out there, you get 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday (still have to buy the jewelry but hey that's a great deal).",0,19kyEIRvGYgxgIrc-FRGCg

My best advice is to get the classic Yard Dog (32oz) size -- if you're looking for high alcohol content, your answer lies in the 44 Magnum: a mix of Hurricane and 190 Octane. It might not be as tasty as some of the other flavors, but you'll get the best bang for your buck! I also recommend adding an extra shot (only $1!). Of course, all the flavors are delicious if you don't care about how much alcohol there is, but my second choice is always Pina Colada, Mardi Gras Mash, or Margarita with added salt on the top of the cup.

**NOTE** I would highly advise against buying anything with more volume than the Yard Dog unless you're splitting it with one or more people. I'm not questioning the volume you can drink, only the speed -- you do not want a melted daiquiri on your hands. It's disgusting. 

All the workers here are so, so lighthearted and do their best to make you laugh. I've never seen a single worker at Fat Tuesday without a smile on their face.

The worst aspect about this place is that because of its great location (in the Miracle Mile shops), it's the most popular Fat Tuesday in Vegas -- and the line can get incredibly long. However, they do try to make it as efficient as possible by making sure you have your ID out at the front of the line. If you're waiting with friends, it shouldn't take too long to get your drink. This should go for all of Vegas, but don't forget your ID! They only accept certain forms of identification, so if you have an ID card from another country, it's safest to just bring your passport. 

**TIP** Bring back your old container and save a few bucks on your next drink! For the Yard Dog (32oz), a regular drink is $14, and the discounted price is $11.",1,V4nNUVs8X9ncc8eAJ9unvg

The last few times I've been here, I can't help but notice how exceptionally lazy and unqualified she is. I used to be a manager so I know there are times when you have other duties to take care of, so you're unable to help your staff out, but she seems to take advantage of that power.

I was at this location a while back and noticed her kind of just hanging out while the other workers were slammed with a line of people. Since then, I've started to pay more and more attention to it each time I come. After today, I don't think I will be returning to this location.

I came during the lunch rush and to no surprise, walked in to find the employees hard at work and the manager doing..... nothing but standing there with the worst resting b*tch face I've seen in a while. So, being the person I am, asked her a simple question to see if maybe I was wrong about her. But nope. Her personality matched her face perfectly. A short b*tchy answer and then she went and hid out in the back. 

A little word of advice, try being a little more pleasant and helpful like the rest of your staff and maybe you wouldn't be so miserable. 

5 stars to the rest of the staff and facility itself. Get rid of her and I'm sure this location would do a lot better.",1,beWKptIp41y8znEKX8yl4g

This buffet is a little more expensive than other hotels, but if you're a gambler, chances are you'll get a free ticket with a fair amount of play.

The owner was very friendly and welcoming.  Seating was first come, first serve which was nice, bathroom was clean and drink prices were reasonable ($4.25 for 22oz Bud Light)...but those were probably the only decent things about the place. 

Our service was horrible.  I ordered a beer and waited 20 minutes to finally get it.  That was it, no service for the rest of the night.  My fiance wanted to order a drink but they never made it back over to our table.  So our tab came to $8 bucks with tip.. Did I save money on a drink tab? Sure..but it would've been nice to have a few drinks.

The comedy was dreadful.  I frequent comedy clubs a few times a year,  but these comics were horrible.  I laughed 3-4 times the entire hour and 15 minutes.  The crowd was eerily quite at times and seem uninterested the majority of the show.  We waited for the ""headliner"" Jonathan Gregory hoping he'd be better than the previous.  WRONG.  We literally wanted to stand up and leave half way through his act, we didn't because we aren't rude people.  His comedy was weird and strange.  Staring off into the crowd & ceiling in silence for 60 seconds just isn't funny.  Just a very strange approach..

When it comes to the higher end hotels on the Las Vegas Strip this one is at the top of my list. The suites come with a bedroom section that has it's own television and a feeling of privacy from the sunken living room. 

The living room has a flat screen television along with a nice table to get that ""work you promised your boss"" you would do while on the road. The couch is a huge sectional and pretty comfortable for your ""club randoms"" to crash on at night. Great huge bathroom and an overall quality in your suite will leave you sleeping fantastically every night.

My female friend was very disappointed that in November the pool was pretty much cast in shadows all day which really seems like a design error. Clearly the pool area was designed by men if they didn't think woman would want to bask in the sun all day. 

Another bonus is your attached to the Palazzo Hotel which has some great dining/shopping options. It also doubles your indoor gambling space without having to endure the evil Vegas sun. If you are brave enough to walk outside you have a pretty central location on the Strip making it a quick stumble to anywhere you really want to get or a cheap cab. 

Bring some cash if your going to gamble at the Venetian since you will run into some of the higher staked tables on the Strip as well. Parking structure is always crowded but the amount of security leaves me feeling better about leaving the car inside the deck than most places.

The best kept secret at  the Venetian is the Grand Lux Cafe. It is the best valued place to eat on the Strip if you want good food at less than $15 a plate, here is my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-6#hrid:jzPqiv5JxNLjVhJB7sJCKg",1,OsGZTAZw-0FNz5v0trbSsQ

After combing through many reviews I made a reservation at  Scarpetta a week in advance. The three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. Our table looked out to the Bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. 

Great disappointment fell over me as I began to eat the Farmer's Market Salad. Beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies BUT unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. 

We both ordered pasta dishes. My bf the duck foie gras ravioli and I the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pasta itself was light and delicious. The Marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. However, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful.

This theater is terrible. The only reason I am giving one star is because I have to, and I guess because my boyfriend and I were 2 of 6 people in the movie we went to here.

No stadium seating. It's 2012. Get stadium seating.

Tiny movie screen, bright annoying overhead lights, seats that are terribly uncomfy, and a sad little snack bar. 

I got a Groupon for buy one get one tickets here. I received the tickets in the mail and decided to see Act of Valor. When I arrived at the theater I was greeted with the fact that I had to shell out $1.50 extra per ticket because I was seeing a movie that was less than 2 weeks old. Gee, thanks AMC and GROUPON.

Each time we go I think it gets better.  for the most part we have very satisfying meals and experiences here.  The service is good, the staff is friendly, the food is hot and fresh and I always get enough food for leftovers. The hibachi dinners are always filled with lots of yummy, fresh veggies and lots of meat. I'm a veggie person so I find this to be a good ratio of veggies to meat. Some places skimp on veggies but not here. I also like this place especially well because it's one of the few hibachi dinnerplaces that I've visited that  serves fried rice AND noodles.  And how I love the noodles! The order that the hibachi dinner is cooked and the speed in which it is cooked  means that nothing gets cold while you're waiting to eat everything together and that is important to me. I always get some sushi when here and it's one place around that I think has some good sushi for the area. We're not drinkers so I can't comment on the alcoholic beverages.

On the last visit we had 5 adults and a 4 year old.  the hibachi chef wowed the youngest of the group with fire and tricks while cooking our meals! The adults of the group got saki from a  squeeze bottle to keep them busy and entertained! We each got something different for our hibachi meat choice... chicken, salmon, steak, and combo. They were all great. We ordered a couple of sushi items and traded around. There was nothing left of the sushi by the time the meals were served.

I used to be with AT&T long ago and then left for the other big company.  However, since coming back I have been very pleased with the service I have received.  There are a few times, when I am not in a major metro area when my coverage is spotty, but for the most part, I have no problems.

As far as this particular location goes, the last two times I have been lucky enough to have Meagan helping me and she is wonderful.  The first time I met her was right after my phone decided to take a bath.  I was eligible for a phone upgrade in 2.5 months, so I really didn't want to spend the money to buy a new iPhone (because why would I get anything else) at full price.  She suggested I take it into the Apple store to see if they would replace it under the warranty, which they usually don't for water damage, but might because of the cracks.  She was right.  They did replace it (because Apple is awesome) and she saved me $400!!  

This last time she helped me with the phone upgrade and was just as kind and helpful as the first time.  She seems very genuine and is full of smiles which makes me feel like she is a friend looking out for me and not someone trying to get the big sale.

It seems like everyone is wondering who is going to switch back to Verizon now that they have the iPhone too.  Well, I will tell anyone that will listen that I am happy with AT&T.

And I will reiterate, just start calling this location, ""Walmart""...because it is very clear that the employees and management team cannot hold up to what Target's standards are supposed to be. 

I avoid this Target at all costs if need be, you can smell the bathrooms that are located in the front of the store all the way in the back of the store. It's dirty, it's unorganized. I've said enough.

I'm re-writing this review because of the experience I had yesterday evening with an associate, Carlo. 

Yesterday evening I brought my son (who is 18 months old) in for a quick errand. We stopped by the bargain section and I let him pick out a sippy cup.

At checkout, I was speaking to the cashier (Carlo) about a price check - which he already had an attitude with me. 

Before I continue let me just point out that I am pretty well mannered, I have my child under control and I'm a normal person, not doing anything to deserve this attitude. 

While speaking with Carlo, my son, WHO IS 18 MONTHS. Is trying to hand him the sippy cup to scan it, he's not screaming or crying or tempering, just reaching the cup towards him that doesn't even reach up half way to his chest. 

Mid-conversation, Carlo grabs my son's wrist and yanks the sippy cup out of his hand like he was holding a firework and did something wrong.

Admittedly, I have never had something like this happen with my son. Ever. So I didn't even react, I was just in shock. He didn't say anything, scoffed at me, didn't thank me at the end, say have a nice night, nothing.

I left the store embarrassed and in shock thinking I did something wrong as a parent. I considered calling management but thought I was overreacting. Took some time to really think of it and thought, in no way was it moral of this employee to put his hand on my son like that. Even if he was being a brat (which let me remind you, he wasn't). That's not your kid, that's not your job. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON A CUSTOMER'S CHILD FORCEFULLY. 


I contacted the store after thinking and was unable to get a hold of a manager. Shocker. 

That was it for me, never coming to this Walmart again. And I hope I never see Carlo out of his place of employment.

The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.

Would I come back here?  Probably.  I might try the specialty pizzas or just order some different kinds by the slice.  But I just didn't think Aiello's was anything to write home about.

I am a tea NUT and so I was planning to host a brunch for a girlfriend of mine who is getting married here. Judging from the website this looked like a really special place, so I went to go check it out before I made a reservation.
The space is beautiful and the furnishings are top knotch ...and that is where the compliments end. 
I arrived with a friend at 10:15 in the morning on a Saturday. It was us and one other table of two.The place was understaffed and things looked discombulated. There  was one waitress in the whole place which would have been fine if she was experienced and didnt have 10 stitches in her hand from a dishwashing accident a few days before..every plate she carried and tea pot she brought out she was clearly in agony..... but the food was good. The cook was awesome! Very friendly (I met him because he had to come out of the kitchen to help deliver food and clear dishes..). I got a little pissed though when a person who appeared to be the owner arrived and walked around for a second and then disappeared..The girl needed a little help out there..
Dont go here if you expect to find a new tea, have conversation with someone who knows about tea or to buy tea or any accessories. It does not appear that the staff or owners have any knowledge in this regard or know what a tea enthusiast would expect from a place named the Urban Tea Loft.At least that was the impression I got from my visit. I would suggest that the owner take a trip with her employees to even the local Teavana store to observe the employees knowledge and enthusiasm and the items available for purchase. 
That said this place has SO much potential and I really hope that the owners get it together!",2,hgLRP0VzUmGJzHGGWfXX9Q

Was served by Kristin and she went above and beyond to be sure our needs were met. Never had a low drink or dirty plate on the table.

She had a smile and warm attitude throughout our dining experience despite a busy evening for the restaurant. She knew the menu items and even offered suggestions. 
The food was phenomenal. Our table sampled each other's plates and nothing was bad. I had a pasta dish that was a little bland in comparison to the rest of the table's delicious choices but it was far from being bad. The filet oscar my husband had was delicious!!!

Looked it up and to my delight a very well rated italian resto!

Ordered takeout, eggplant parm/vegie lasagna/white pizza. Their white pizza looked amazing, got great reviews, so i went with that. Walked into the place and was instantly hit with the sweet sweet smell of an AMAZING Italian food kitchen. You only get that smell at primo places, I was happy before even getting my food.

Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY. Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing this on their website nor menu, But their is an ATM there.

The food is AMAZING, everything tasted great, was so damn delicious. The pizza is the unique offering -  IMO I think they use a shortening in their dough which gives the crust a semi semi puff pastry texture/flavor. It was really unique and appreciated, and especially on the white pie it went very well.

I would come from anywhere in the city to eat here, but if you're staying at the Trylon appts across the street this is a big plus being so close.

I've been to The Himalayan numerous times since I moved to Calgary and it has been my favorite for years now. I won't do it justice if I don't talk about them.

Bottomline: small boutique restaurant that serves consistent phenomenal flavorful food unique to Calgary. Definitely a must try.

Atmosphere: located on the west end of 17th Ave, this little gem is tucked away in one of the strip malls and easy to miss. Place is constantly busy so make sure to make a reso at least a week ahead of time.

Food: I've been to the restaurant numerous times and have tried almost everything on the menu. There's yet a dish that has disappointed me so far. Everything has great deep flavors and balanced very well. The chef is able to combine Asian cuisine with Indian spices like peanut butter and jam. The end result is something very unique and delicious. Oh and did I mention every table starts off with a light plate of homemade chips and dips? Awesome way to segue into the appys and entrees.

Value: fantastic food at a fantastic price. Considering the quality and taste, this place has everyone beat in regards to price. Expect fine quality food at an affordable price.",1,2vftto4xkC27NJrKPQ2VGw

We went for a birthday dinner - reservations for a large party at 7:00 - and were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and funny, but clearly overworked by having to serve our large party, as well as other nearby tables (perhaps they were short-staffed this particular night??).  That being said, the service was abysmally slow - from drink orders to hot biscuits to the actual dinner to bringing our checks.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but it was clear that the kitchen was slammed - and the managers I observed were spending more time chastising their staff than being helpful (and this was in very plain sight).

My food (burger) was quite good, but I heard several comments from others that their food was just okay.  One guest ordered the roasted beet salad, which, when it arrived, had only about three tiny pieces of  beet in and zero goat cheese.  He very quietly and calmly requested the server take it back and send out the salad as described on the menu.  He got his new salad all right, but he also got a manager with what I perceived as an attitude - questioning him about why he sent it back in a very antagonistic tone.  Not well played, Tupelo Honey, not well played.

We arrived at 7:00 and left at 9:30 - not because we were having so much fun (although we were) but because the service was so very slow - the wait to get our checks and, once we had them, the wait to have them picked up and returned for signatures, was totally ridiculous.

He hovered a little bit but being as there were so few people, I didn't mind.  He had a good product knowledge as well.  We got in and ordered within 10 minutes and had our food delivered literally within about 8 minutes after that. Too soon. Great food though... I don't mind paying prices like that considering it IS in the Encore, and it IS on the strip... so no big deal... successful early 20's couple,  appreciates a good meal, but HERE was the big problem....  

We couldn't even TRY to extend our meal over an hour... we were in at 6:30, out at 7:45 after desert... and in that time, the place switched twice... every half hour, but the ceiling was a) either broken, or b) they don't change it that early in the night.... so basically the whole reason was to see this dramatic switch, the music GOT SUPER LOUDDDD...

My scenario as I write this. I've been here since 10am this morning and bought 2 pumpkin spiced lattes, 2 hot chocolates, a plain bagel, iced coffee, Chocolate chip scone (brought my older daughters with me & my husband) and we've been sitting enjoying the shop and doing some work.  The girl mixed up our drinks but we figured it out after a couple of sips. 

Lunchtime rolls around...getting hungry lol and I place an order with ARI(?) for a medium iced tea and THE CARLOS sandwich at 12:55pm and received my food at 1:23pm. 28 MINUTES LATER!! No word until I walked up front and she saw me, then said it would be a few more minutes. When she brought my food, she had her head down the whole time and whispered, ""You're Welcome"".. which I didn't hear but my husband said she did. He pointed out the fact that  she didn't apologize for the long wait, or mention it at all and didn't even smile when she put the food down on the table and quickly walked away. 

I'm fed up, that's why I'm writing this. I don't think we'll come back. There are other options. It just seems to me that these girls that work here are in their own world and just collecting a paycheck.  No effort to do things right. They don't write down the orders, so if they are inundated with orders, or get a lot of people in drive-thru and in shop...that's not a good thing. They don't pay attention to detail and if the owners not here, that's very evident in all aspects. No music playing, dishes on table, floors dirty, attitudes, etc.

First, we walked in the door to be blasted with the heat of the office.  It's 50 degrees outside and 85 inside.  If that is not bad enough the African American girl behind the desk was a smoker and you could smell her from the front door.  The stench was so strong I had to keep leaving the waiting room because of the cigarette odor.  To make things worse, she got up twice during the time I was waiting and went  outside to smoke more, so each time she came back in the smell in the room just kept getting worse and worse.  The smell traveled all the way down to the waiting rooms after we got in to see the doctor.  This made the whole location seem disgusting and dirty.

Second, as I said it was hot, oppressively hot.  After that they put myself, my wife and my daughter in a 12 by 12 room and closed the door the heat kept building to the point my daughter started to feel light headed.  When I asked them to at least leave the door open, they said it was against hippa laws to leave the door open.

The crust is slightly unconventional, more like a cracker than pizza dough, and very thin, but I consider that an acceptable nuance of their place.

My wife always gets the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza and although you know my perspective on arugula (tastes like fart) she insists it is the cornerstone of her very existence (in her words: ""it's really good.""  she understates).

However today I went against all that is good and right with the world and ordered a salad.  Turkey, avocado, and feta salad.  The feta was decent, the avocado was delightful, the turkey was lunch meat turkey cubes.  not a compliment.  The dressing was light and i definitely felt like i was doing something good for my body.

My body was surprised.

Anyway, the salad was a 3 out of five.  Decent, not wonderful.  So the waitress came and said that if I liked that dressing, they have a secret salad with the same dressing and all sorts of italian cold meats in it.  Sounds amazing!  

So I asked her what gives with the secret salad.  Well it is an idea on the part of some of the higher ups to encourage ppl to return to the place and order the salad.  I say, just put your best shit on the menu, otherwise I won't come back.

So I was intrigued.  But do I like being engaged in a cunning ruse to make me return?  no!

So I browbeat the poor hapless waitress for a few minutes about whose idea it was and so on, and then told her I'd never return to sauce so long as i live.

But I will, because that salad sounds tasty as hell.  Plus, with their salads they serve a nice little bread roll which is pretty wonderful.  Also they serve wine and beer and who doesn't like that?",5,Cwkb0lYxcGk5H4Yg2zMKlg

Like, literally my plate was full after I looked at just 1/4 of the food (not including the desserts).  Some of my favorites were the sweet potato tater tots, chips and guacamole, mashed potatoes and gravy and baked beans.  They had really cool stations that I had never seen at another buffet before, such as artisanal cheese.  I would definitely come back because the food was good and there were a TON of options so if you have a party that has picky eaters, they will likely find something up their alley.

The hostess who sat us was also very nice.  When she found out that my sister had been to the buffet before and recommended that I come, she thanked my sister for returning and suggesting I visit.  They have to know that word of mouth marketing is really strong and you can tell that everyone takes their jobs very seriously.  They had more staff on hand (cleaning tables, setting tables, serving, preparing food) than any other buffet.  They are obviously spending a lot of wages, but the quality of that really comes through.  I even asked someone at the dessert station about desserts without nuts and she didn't know she she checked with someone instead of just guessing (as happened to me at other buffets).  That follow up, even if simple, goes a long way with me.

With that being said, the price was ridiculous.  it was $75 for two of us for lunch.  I know they have to charge that much because of the seafood and sushi, but as a girl with simple tastes, my dinner probably only cost them a couple dollars to make, at most.

drIFrAyZnyismS1ArZlmAg,5,2016-09-04 00:31:11,6,T-sV71I9kcnDnGONsUIftw,"Average vegan Asian food. Not bad, not terribly tasty. If you like processed protein, you will love this place, because just about every dish serves tofu or veggie protein or yam protein (say wha?). You can however make requests for soy-free and gluten-free. 

It's a nice quiet restaurant painted white inside with several tables set for three or four people. The servers are very lax and friendly. Also the menu is colorful with pictures.

Appetizers:

Rainbow salad - Very light dressing covering a mound of exceptionally thin sliced cabbage and veggies. It's topped with slices of veggie protein but I ate around those. Otherwise, a very good salad.

Spring Rolls - Veggie protein is chopped up and mixed in well enough so that it would take too long to pick out. They looked good, but I avoided them. Tasted the accompanying house made peanut sauce and found it to be very weak.

Dumplings - Also looked very good but the veggie protein was blended in so I avoided them. The accompanying house made sauce was very weak.

French fries - Thinly sliced, fried right, and served with basic ketchup.

Entree:

In order to avoid soy and the processed stuffs, I ordered the broccoli-mushroom dish and made special request for a plain eggplant dish. Either brown or white rice could be requested as an addition to the meal, but I opted for a side of noodles. Glad I did. 

Also, glad I ordered two dishes because ended up combining them into one, just to get a full meal. The mushrooms were awfully rubbery; they went to waste. So I paired the broccoli florets with my eggplant and stirred in the noodles. That was good. 

Beverage:

Orange juice with mint flavor and topped with flowers. I thought the orange was going to be fresh, but it tasted like it was straight from a carton. (That is the last time I believe a server who says the restaurant sells fresh juice.) The mint was an artificially dark green colored overly sweet syrup at the bottom of the glass. Not worth it.

Dessert:

Slice of maple cinnamon cake. A-Okay. Not too thick and not overly sweet. A trained tongue can tell that it's vegan.",4,X5T45QxyLjnuXohkvE3Rfw

Man, I'm lucky to work around the corner from this place (for the past 6 years and I'm just now trying them?!  Shame!!)  I love Pad Thai and I decided to try Satay a few weeks ago.  I ordered Chicken Pad Thai at a heat level of 3.  HOLY BALLS!  A 3 is like an 8 at Pin Kaow.  Much more spicy than I expected, but the flavors were still really delicious and fresh.

After having it for the first time, I crave it once a week!  I have dialed the heat down to 2 and it's a good level (for someone that usually orders a 3 at Pin Kaow).

Delivery had always been fast (I work in Howard Hughes) and the food is piping hot!

The first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad. 

The second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. 

Today I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, ""dessert"", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal! 

 The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection! 

The dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together. 

This would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.

 Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone.",2,HzEtbh5KYzfeW_MTVnGCEA

VP6sXk-A0TrO0GGDmFOtkg,0,2010-08-10 01:00:05,16,wfQiwtkgjp7cP1biVDuqBQ,"Walked in here with as a bridesmaid with her bride on the morning of her wedding for a hairstyling.  The best I can said is that the bride, who wanted a retro up-do, did get what she wanted.  

I, however, found the one and only salon stylist who has no clue how to do a straight blow out.  She literally Did.  Not.  Know.  

Let me start by saying I've got Keratin treated hair and it's actually been within the past two months.  This means I need sulfate-free shampoo and I made sure to bring some of my own (with my own product too just in case) because really, what I wanted was just the blow dry which saves time and effort having someone else do it.  The KEratin makes it all super easy to just blow out.  But not if you got the girl I did.

While washing my ahri she wouldn't stop talking about how she wanted to get some hot rollers heating up for me.  I told her several times she shouldn't need to do anything like that.  All I wanted was the blow dry and maybe help pinning up a flower on one side of my head.

She began with my bangs and started to fluff them, blow dry against the cuticle, and rat with a brush.  I had to stop her and suggest she blow air in the opposite direction to keep it all smooth.  She warned me I wouldn't get any volume that way.  I explained again to her that I paid several hundred $ to get the volume and curl all out of my hair and that I wanted smooth and sleep and straight and that there was zero desire for volume.  She, with her 4inch-plus-ratted-hair-from-scalp-look, said she couldn't believe that because she could just make it look ""so purty"".

I normally wouldn't mock someone else's hair style so badly but when they work in the industry and refuse to listen to instructions on how to do the most simple of all salon styling procedures?  It's on.  

After offering her more tips (use the round brush to hold the hair and help heat the hair with the dryer blowing on the brush), she had got maybe 1/8 of hair dry when she turned off the blow dryer and announced she had to then go wash out another client's color.  

My hair was drying and frizzing (despite the Keratin!) right before my eyes since it wasn't getting proper heat drying!    I was near tears and had to go to the bathroom to calm myself down (reminded myself at least my friend the bride was getting the style she wanted and worst case was I had to wash and do my own hair all over).  

When I got my stylist's attention again I told her I was worried that she was letting my hair dry and frizz and reminded her that this took me abut 30 minutes to do, 20 mins if I went to salon (which I've done several times) and we were running past 45 minutes.  She told me she just wanted me to let her do it her way.  To me, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I pay to my hair done how I want it.  

My friend the bride finished her up do long before mine was even half dry and I knew I just needed to get out of the chair but not before the receptionist came over to inquire from my stylist how much to charge.  And then I got to listen in on my stylist whining that is was a very difficult case since I had treated hair (which should have made the blow dry talk half the time anyone else with the same amount of hair but that's only if one understands the concept of a blow straight).  I bit my tongue and didn't point out I had to bring all my own product and wasn't getting virtually any service whatsoever and just let her ramble on and decide to charge $35 for a butchery of a blow out.  

Final story?  This salon was a very terrible experience.  I'm appalled at the lacking experience and attitude from the stylist I had and disappointed in the lack of anyone intervening from the salon when it must have been obvious the stylist assigned to me was inadequately skilled to meet my needs. 

Do Not Recommend.  Unless you like the Texas big hair Dynasty look.  Then it's perfect.",19,_s4Vnw8Opd-kPwaSXOuK3Q

When we had 15 minutes before our flight was boarding, I somehow still convinced the husband we could swing it. When we were up, I asked the cashier how long it would take for a honey shrimp. I was happy that she took the time to ask the manager just to be sure.. and she told us 10 minutes. We paid extra for the fried rice and planned to split the entree between us. 10 minutes for our order to be up was spot on! Super happy for the quick turnaround and they even put plenty of napkins and enough silverware in the bag. Score. Now we get to be those jerks on the plane with the delicious smelling food. Ha! The honey shrimp was SO good. It has been awhile since I've been to a P.F. Chang's, but I would only order the crispy honey shrimp there and this was, I believe, the exact same (they are owned by the same company). Delicious and cooked to order. Loved it!

Thought I would try something new and different for dinner tonight.... (never been to a Salsaritas).

Went to the line to order. As i went down the line I ordered Steak.  The guy said ""That's gonna be a little extra"".  I said, "" that's OK"".   Then i asked for peppers and onions..... ""That's gonna be a little extra"".   Um,  ""OK"".  ......"" I would also like Chips and Guac please"".   He says....""OK, that's gonna be a little extra"".   I said, ""well, of course it is.  I would expect nothing less.""  

I get to the register and ran up a $15 bill.  Looked at the small portion i got for $15 and thought to myself....""i hope this is at least somewhat good.""

It was less than mediocre.  The steak was dry, the queso tasted like sanitizer, the chips were way over salted.  About the only thing that tasted good was the Sweet Tea.

Also, how can they justify $1.50 more for 1 small scoop of Sautéed peppers and onions.  I mean hell, you can get 1 green Pepper and 2 onions for that price at the grocery.

Basically, this is an overpriced fast food Mexican joint lacking a lot of taste to be desired.

Was out on business with my biz partner and we were a bit out of our 'hood and our element, so the biz partner looked up local restos with free WiFi and stumbled upon this lovely nook of a sammie joint.   Glad she did.  

First off, just like it says on their website, they are a bit hard to find. The location is nestled away on the NW corner of 90th Street & Via Linda.  They're in a shopping center with a Fry's and an assortment of spa & wellness boutiques and a DVD conversion place.  The location is small, cozy, and eccentrically decorated like a slice of Vermont-icana (if that's even a word), with chill retro tunes playing and nods to ""The Dead"" and hippie-ish verbiage on their menu, which leads me to the food...

The food was AMAZING!  Based on some other Yelp reviews,  I got the Long Trail.  It was great!  Fresh, fresh, fresh with homemade condiments and tons of fresh veggies.  It came with a choice of salad (I chose pasta), and I also added a cup of deliciously chilled squash soup, in the style of a Vichyssoise or gazpacho.  Pure, chilled perfection.  My biz partner had a chicken salad wrap (The Deadhead) that was completely over-the-top delicious! We swapped bites of our respective lunches but I was unable to convince her to do tradesies on the second halves of our individual sandwiches.  Hers was amazing and on my target list of the next visit.  We also sampled and then bought an AMAZING fresh maple-chocolate chip cookie that blew my mind!  I'd bathe in that recipe!!

The best part of the experience was the staff.  We got there towards the end of the lunch rush and once the place cleared out and settled down a little, the owners generously took time to engage us in genuine conversation.  They are exquisitely down-to-earth, authentically nice and completely friendly, affable and accommodating.  We talked about everything from history to digital marketing to high school with them.  It was kinda like having lunch with old friends -- who we just met!!!  

Totally sweet people and I wish them the best of success.  If they continue to run & build their business as they have been doing, there's no doubt in my mind they'll take the Vermont Sandwich Company anywhere they want it to go.  They deserve it; fresh, ample portions, fantastic ambiance and genuinely nice, caring service.  I wish all small businesses ran this way!",12,MhbjMiuR74hpqgrjdlZmoQ

I am actually privileged enough to drive this beautiful route every day to work. The road that starts from Blue Diamond RD and dumps you into Summerlin, is the most amazing stretch of road in Las Vegas. 

The ""Red Rock Loop"" is something you should take the time to see no matter if you are a local or tourist. If you are into hiking, biking, rock climbing, bouldering, photography, (...and the list goes on) this place is right up your alley. 

*If you are really into rock climbing, the post from ""noriko n. Bishop, CA"" is spot on!

The Visitor Center is great for kids. It is very educational and schools often take field trips out there.

I have been here a number of times and I have always enjoyed the food here. This time, we got xiao long bao/soup dumplings, an egg/onion pancake thing, rice roll thing, spicy tofu, regular dumplings, and a bun that you dip into condensed milk. For the most part I liked everything except I could have done without the spicy tofu. The bun with condensed milk was really good, but so simple, it's like something you can just make at home yourself. Whatever they put into their dumplings was seriously addictive like crack though, like I couldn't stop eating them and just thinking about them now is making me salivate.

The Croissant French Toast is out of this world, it's moist, crisp, delicate, and buttery all at once!  The problem is you'll have to choose between that and the Chicken and Waffles, which come with a Strawberry Whipped butter.  I literally ate the strawberry butter like ice cream - my heart doesn't feel good, but my taste buds said it was worth it!  

The only issue with the Chicken and Waffles is that you have to make a decision on what to dip your chicken in: the strawberry butter?  Some syrup with a little waffle?  Or do you use the house made BBQ sauce, that is smoky and spicy with a great flavor?  

Not there for breakfast or want more of a lunch or dinner option?  You have to consider the Huevos Rancheros - large chips with beans, salsa, cheese, your choice of eggs, and my favorite - FRIED JALAPENOS!  They are soooooo tasty to pick off and eat.  

Think you can handle any dish?  Then order the Holy Davoli Burger.  The patty is well sized, cooked to pink in the middle burger and then placed between a pair of grilled cheese sandwiches with some pickle slaw...it's more than a mouthful to bite!

Even though I read where it was I still had a hard time finding it. It is on the 3rd floor near several other restaurants. Literally look for a dimly lit hallway with old record albums lining the wall. If you see a pinball machine straight ahead you've found it! 

I lived near Chicago for 11 years so it's hard for me to appreciate anything other than Chicago style pizza (deep dish an/or thin crust with sweeter sauce). That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice. 

The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection.

Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar.

Pros - Nice selection of vintage video games, used video games and video game accessories. Fair prices on products they buy from you. Good service and a knowledgeable staff. Great prices on used games and movies! 

Cons - Definitely focused on gamers. If you're looking for used movies then Zia has a wider selection than here. 

Nice find....

I'd definitely recommend this place for gamers!",10,UGlYryF2DKbmBhTa7kq5WQ

Unfortunately, the first time I went, we got there around closing time so I didn't really get to do any exploring or anything and I just rode the carousel before having to leave. Ever since that day, I've yearned to go back so that maybe, just maybe I could relive those golden days of childhood. Sadly, the mall is just a shell of its former self and little did I know, it was a shell even back in 2004 when I first visited. The mall seems to be an insanely popular hangout for senior citizens because the food court was packed with them, which isn't really a bad thing because at least they're getting out but it makes the place eerie and somewhat depressing seeing nothing but elderly people hanging out like the teenagers once did in the mall's distant prime. Although most stores were closed, all my favorite stores were still open like Jimmy Jazz and Champs and Pac Sun and all the other shoe stores so in my book, this mall is still quite amazing just not as good for people who prefer to shop in other stores. I'd love to see the mall make a comeback and hopefully be restored to its former glory but I just don't see it happening. Nonetheless, it's still a really fun place to spend your day and at least it has air conditioning for those boiling hot days when there's nothing else to do. But honestly, I think the mall's demise was somewhat evident if you ask me: look at the place, you have to drive to the end of the earth just to get there and it's basically in the middle of nowhere surrounded by limitless waves of used car dealers. They should've built it in a more central location.",1,cHcZ99cHsYASLVf_f1kNNA

Talking with no smartphones.. it was horrible. The interior is dark, cool, polished and has a sleek modern appearance. I prefer this kind of environment that's very dark, so if this isn't your thing you may not enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic date night. I ordered a mojito and it tasted like a very watery mojito with barely there liquor and a few mint leaves floating around in the glass. Sent it back and ordered a sangria instead which was much better. I am fortunate enough to have access to some of the best wines, so I never really order their wines here. They offer cabinets to store your own wine. The jumbo shrimp cocktail sauce was bland to my shrimp cocktail. Lucky Wishbone where are you?!?! I longed for just a bit of horseradish..
The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal. I think they were having an off night I guess because the restaurant was absolutely dead inside until it started to pick up at the end.

 I used to rave that this was my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. 
NOT ANYMORE.

Perhaps my tastes have changed, maybe I have higher expectations for service...or this place has both bland and  poorly executed food, with bad/slow service to boot.

To start, I arrived with my significant other (who is a chef) at around 7 last night. There wasn't a hostess to greet us at the door. After waiting about 3-5 minutes someone came over to greet us while carrying a load of dirty dishes, walked passed us with them and set them down on the table behind us. Mind you I understand she was helping out, but there were less than 7 tables in the place and she could have set the dishes down first away from the host stand. But she sounded friendly enough, and took us to a table inside, in a room with only one large party placed in the middle (all other tables were empty). And sat us directly next to the party, next to the loudest section of that party, where we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone hear each other. I asked to move, and the hostess moved us only one table away but still DIRECTLY next to this loud party. I then asked to be moved further and she chose one more table away from that but STILL directly next to the party. Then I complained for the third time and the guy watering our table let us finally move across the room despite ALL of the empty tables in the place. 

So I try to start again fresh focusing on the menu. My guest orders bruschetta to start for the both of us. It arrives rather quickly. The bread is about the same as what was already on the table except instead it has a thin slice of Smoked tomato and a few pieces of ricotta cheese and is really hard being overly toasted. The taste was bland because there literally wasn't anything to the bruschetta besides a slice of tomato and ricotta cheese...NO Olive Oil (which it desperately needed because it was dry), and NO salt/cracked pepper (considering it was BLAND). the only saving grace was the slice of tomato and still we would have been better off with the free bread on the table because at least that came with butter so it wasn't completely dry and a value.

Next we received our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, which was pretty decent. I ordered the Braised Short Rib Gnocci dish which I have had at least 3 times.  But this time it was bland. It was supposed to have a Gorgonzola sauce. I could barely taste the cheese, there may have been a tiny hint of it according to my boyfriend (who didn't like it) and it needed salt. However, the short rib was cooked perfectly and there were plenty of the tasty mushrooms but I wished I had something with more flavor.

As for the service, it was slow and awkward. To start I had to request 3 times to be moved. Between the ""appetizer"" and Main Course my server took my B&B plate out of my hand while I was moving it closer to me and said ""thank you"" like I was handing it to her. She obviously misunderstood me, leaving me confused and stuck holding my silverware in my hands as I had nothing to set it on until I reached over and grabbed another small plate off the table next to us.  It was incredibly uncomfortable. The server also disappeared for a long time after we were finished with our meal. My boyfriend wanted to order dessert but decided against it due to the slow service, and chose to have dessert at Sweet Moses instead.

So at the end, all I enjoyed was the Blackberry and Mint cocktail, the decor and music. And my Boyfriend, the chef, said the only thing he enjoyed about dinner was dessert at Sweet Moses. They gave us excellent service, the coffee and sundaes we ordered were perfectly delicious, coffee was fresh, we liked it so much we even ordered a slice of apple pie and tipped out the staff enough that they weren't sure if it was a mistake or not.

All in all, if you are looking to have an exceptional meal while out on the town, I would pass on Luxe. But if you want Cocktails and atmosphere and maybe to share a few dishes (so you're not committed to just one in case it's bland) this could be the place for you.",1,_FafQqqr61rtC5SzsywkPQ

Morimoto is definitely a pricey restaurant. It will cost about $100/person if you don't get steaks. Of course, in a high end restaurant like this one, the alcohol will cost you. We got a bottle of sake, 600ml, and it was $88. Oh yeah, the flaming chocolate ball. It cost $20, but when you see other tables ordering it, you would want one too.

Pros:

* very spacious
* many large, comfy leather couches (so many, in fact, that there was at least one couch available for each person waiting for surgery - no sharing with strangers!)
* low table in front of each couch
* wifi available and signs explaining how to access said wifi
* pretty, calming animal and nature shows playing on the flat screens rather than annoying CP24 - and no tv sound!
* solid music choices - not musak, not elevator jazz, a good background combo of quiet pop, folk, and classics
* free coffee, fruit, and cookie/muffin snacks 

Cons: 

* located in Mississauga (which, from my downtown, bike-riding perspective, might as well be on the moon)
* the whole room is brightly lit, with no dim area for those recovering from surgery

I have to say that the only reason this place got 3 stars was for the excellent service we got from Amber at the bar. She was on top of the drinks, snappy banter and baseball so I was very happy!

WHEN YOU GO- I was not impressed by even their chips and salsa. The chips in our nachos were 10X better so I feel like the table chips sit around for awhile. We also had the mixed enchiladas and steak fajitas and both were pretty dang flavorless. Drinks and nachos are the only thing I'd order here again.

I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me. If you've never been before, at least one person at your party should order the marscapone y speck pizza to share with the group. It is simply delightful.

Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of. 

The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait.

My wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas recently, while we were in town for our wedding/honeymoon week (4/22-4/26/12). We should have gone here instead of going to Alize upstairs on the night of our wedding. The vibe at N9NE is young, hip and chic (but no one is out of place). If you don't mind paying a lot of money for really good food, then this is the place for you. I had the wedge salad, the 16 oz. bone-in filet with a king crab leg, and a wonderful wheat beer. Although you are going to pay an arm and a leg for the food (we paid $350), I believe it was WELL worth it.

I disagree with Jordan A. - you would expect a place like this to be pretentious - but the staff that we encountered (hostess, waiter, bus boys) were all very nice, and very attentive.

I'm giving 3 stars (generously) because the food did taste good for the most part but service and handling of issues was a big turn off. 
My roomate and I placed separate orders through the Yelp app. I ordered the small Greek salad and gyro combo and chose the ""pay with cash"" option. He placed his order and chose to pay with card, so the transaction had already gone through by the time we arrived. The app said that the wait time would be 10-35 minutes, so I called the restaurant before to get a better estimate/make sure they had received the orders. I called 3 TIMES with no answer, so we decided to head that way to be safe. 
When we arrived, there was a paper sign on the door that read ""closed for democratic event"", but walked up anyway because we had already paid for a portion of our order. After some struggle, it was found that only one order was received (mine) and the card transaction was ""not received"" but payment had already been taken out...strange. The ""owner"" (when I asked if she owned the place, her response was ""it depends on the day of the week"") quickly prepared the other order and sent us on our way without an apology or any encouraging reason to come back and visit. I understand that the restaurant was preparing for an event, but also feel that customer service ALWAYS comes first and that the staff could have handled things better. 
In the end, I did enjoy my gyro, despite the fact that it was fullllll of tomatoes, which I requested to be left out. Same thing with the Greek salad. Full of tomatoes and wayyyyy too much of the Greek dressing. I may come by again, but will explore other options first.",1,K6hwrdh_RMph9DCRtXbZMQ

From the moment I walked in, Jamie, the bar manager introduced himself to me and was really friendly. The restaurant was empty, but the patio was full. It was windy outside, so we sat inside. The decor is fresh, simple and modern. Very cool place to get together with some friends or an informal date. The menu is interesting and varied. Our table of 4 ordered a bunch of different things to share: the arugula salad, the rotisserie chicken sliders, margherita flatbread, tuna and watermelon salad and herbed frites. All the dishes were good, and well-presented. By the end of the meal, we were all satisfied, and not overly-stuffed. 

We also ordered some cosmos and some glasses of Moscato D'Asti. The drinks were very, very good. The cosmos were different from ones I've had at other places. More fresh, fruity and refreshing. And the Moscato was AMAZING. Absolutely PERFECT summer wine. 

The main standout of 80th and Ivy, however, was the service. Our waitress Chelsea was friendly, warm and gave the right amount of space. She seemed genuinely interested in providing us with nice, attentive service. Jamie kept to check up on us again while we were eating. My friends thought I must have known Jamie from before, seeing as to how attentive him and his staff were to us. But no, this was my first time there, and we truly felt like valued patrons. This is a rare occurrence in this city. Well, in any city for that matter.

Now, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:

Burger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.

Inside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.

Patty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency! 

Cheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.

Filling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.

Sides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment.

The servers working all look good especially in them blue two piece. Overall we dropped $250 with $50 tip so it was worth it. A lot less expensive then other day clubs.

We were booked for a non-smoking King room, didn't get it. 3 Hotel rooms for a 2 night stay is extremely inconvenient, and the way this was handled was at best disappointing and unfortunately will not be back to this hotel. So let's start the story by saying this was our first time away from our 15mo old daughter. Upon check in we were offered an upgrade to a mini suite for an additional $15 a night....who wouldn't jump on that for a romantic weekend getaway?! Walking into the room the smoke hit you like a brick wall! The windows open to air out, it was almost as if the person was still in there chain smoking. Our friends walked in and her eyes started burning and watering. Immediately my husband calls the front desk to change rooms (15mins from initial check in), they informed him that they didn't have another mini suite to move us to, so he said I'll take our old room without the upgrade, that's fine. They then tell him that they don't have that either and that they only have a 2 Queen non smoking....we take that. So basically it seemed as though they over sold, never had our king non smoking and were trying to make money off of their mistake. They said they would call us tomorrow to switch our room to what we had booked. We waited until 6pm with no phone call and had to speak to them when we arrived back at our hotel.",0,X9McDPDOHJkQOxO6NPnD_Q
PAmyAhNhGII0cfrn4BPOew,2,2013-12-26,0,zCC1aPKOnWnjvg7Jng4XhA,"Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in ""soul food,"" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less ""real"" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entrée, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended.",4,JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw

My hair was dry, split, and broken.  It was attracting hummiingbirds, who thought they might nest in it.   I did a bit of web research, and felt Christophe might have the kind of expert coloring and conditioning I was searching for.  

The salon is beautiful, a bit hidden in the back of the huge MGM hotel complex, and it overlooks the elaborate pool area.  The stations are sleek and clean, modernistically streamlined.  Sunlight flooded the stations, and made for a pleasant ambience.

I made an appointment with Jean-Marc at Christophe, and had a brief consultation when I arrived.  My colorist Paul, also consulted in great detail, to be sure of the effect I wanted.  I had gathered several pictures, since color is extremely hard to describe save visually, and also had a style discussion.  I wanted a bit of a trendy retro look, a slight bouffant, and believable honey blond streaks.  Paul proceeded to do the most precise job of streaking my hair that I have ever have.  I have long, normally strong straight hair, and he patiently streaked my entire mane.  He also touched up the brass at the roots, and did a marvelous conditioner, that made my hitherto straw locks look like silk.  The L'Oreal hair products I got to continue the condition have helped my hair heal.

Then I had the pleasure of Jean Marc creating a personal style appropriate to my yen for glamour, and busy lifestyle.  He quickly and masterfully rendered a long Bardot-inspired cut, which took advantage of my slight natural wave, and created a casual, yet suave look.  At $150.00 for the cut, it is a bargain.

When I left the salon, I was walking on air, my newly blown-dry mane signaling the resurection of a devoted fashionista.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-berkeley-5

The time where they used to use Otis Spunkmeyer cookies and Double Rainbow ice cream...true story! Workers said so, and I even snapped a photo of the proof!
  ...Back then, a CREAM cookie sandwich was just $1.50...Back then, it was a cool experience and a great concept.

Fast forward to 2015, multiple franchises in Cali, and CREAM's first out of state location right here in Summerlin. The crowds came out with great anticipation for their grand opening waiting for just about an hour to get their hands on their own customized cookie sandwich. Using their foolproof ordering system, I went with White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies(you may mix and match if you wish) Coconut Ice Cream, and no additional toppings. 

I had no issues with my order, as my cookies were soft and warm, and I got a generous scoop. What kinda threw us off though is that when we were done, Wifey asked if they were using the same cookies and ice cream like their flagship location, and almost immediately, two employees went on the defensive and denied EVER using Otis Spunkmeyer and Double Rainbow. They later stated that it may have happened at their other locations, but never at their first location.(Ummm...take a look at my photo!) What they say they use now is the owner's proprietary recipes for both the cookies and ice cream.

Whatever the matter is, I think CREAM will do well and survive the growing pains in Vegas because there's always a crowd searching for a dessert spot that won't break the bank. Hopefully team CREAM can iron out their inconsistencies because judging by the reviews, you're already off to a shaky start. ALOHA!!!

The restaurant itself is very quaint and modern, with a pretty crazy bathroom that has an automatic lid lifting bidet and unique sink. The associates in the store are all very friendly. After reviewing the menu and learning about the 12 dollar minimum per guest (you've been warned) I opted for the Carib and Mars. 

The pastry chef creating the dessert was meticulous and extremely detailed with the creation. From the careful color spraying of the Mars dish to the piping of each part of the Carib cup, it was like watching an art piece come together. However, the disappointment was mainly with the flavor of the desserts even though they looked so pretty. The Mars white chocolate dome gets a nice dosage of flaming cognac to melt the chocolate and expose the inner ingredients. I felt as though I was just eating a super fancy yogurt, because the base had some granola and the ""filling"" was topped with two berries. The Carib cup was covered with a chocolate kid and then some hot filling is poured on top to drizzle through the lid and into the cup. The flavor was not good nor bad, but I just found it odd to mix coconut panna cotta with hazelnut, mango, and melon. 

Overall, this would not be a place I would wait 30+ minutes like some people did. I also ended up spending about 30 bucks for two people. If you're into the experience and nice looking foods, then I would highly recommend visiting at least once.",1,lZiqaMOH-thX0t48mT0Qug

Ordered up a pretty non-traditional BBQ chicken pizza, and watched as they pulled out the dough, pressed it in a machine, topped it off generously, and then finally sent it to the gas-oven to get cooked.  The final 12-inch pie that came out was super thin with a slight limp on the crust near the center, and crisp on the very outer edge.  

Flavorful, fast, and quite fresh, I have to say this is some great pizza!  While some articles have the owner maketing this as ""neapolitan like"", I'd have to disagree and say that this is pretty far from a traditional neapolitan style pizza...

But that doesn't make it bad.... to the contrary, the pizza is delicious from crust to toppings.  If only I had more free time in Vegas, I would've come back for a few more meals.

Verdict:  If you're looking for a purist Neapolitan pie, this isn't it.  But if you want some delicious pizza that's fast, fresh, and flavorful, you've found your place.  It's a shame a gem like this is hidden in the lower levels of MGM.  I hope your business goes well and I look forward to coming back for more pizzas!",2,_qRV6YI3wm6hF0SF-2z8ng

awI4hHMfa7H0Xf0-ChU5hg,1,2017-05-11 01:23:28,0,izSOMhCAkVbCq1Onnkb-gw,"I've heard about this place from friends and after a month, I decided to make it to give it a try on my regular trips to Vegas and I am glad I did.

So the wait is about as horrible as everyone says.  If you go during the busy times, which is anything around regular meal times, expect the wait to be at least 2 hours.  I heard the light times are only around 3am or so.  One time I went at 3pm and it was only 1.5 hours wait.  Yeah, that is considered short during regular times.  Ever since I tried this place, I make sure I go there whenever I am in town.

Onto the main part of the review, the food!

Gumbo - Definitely order the seafood and get extra crab and lobster and sausage, even though the regular portions are generous enough, but I like more food in my gumbo than usual.  I only go for the level 2 or 3 spicy because I have heard some horror stories about how spicy it can get once you go to 4 and beyond.  I think 9 and 10 might just be inedible to most mortals.  It goes very well with the scoop of rice you get, but it can get very filling.  I don't think I have ever finished a whole bowl and I have always had to take home half.

Jambalaya - It's not a soup/stew but rather, a dry rice cooked in Cajun spices and served heaping with seafood.  It's less salty and filling than the gumbo but that doesn't mean I can finish a whole bowl either.

Raw Oysters - Definitely get it.  Their yellow band oysters are some of the biggest I have ever seen.  The oysters are juicy and plump and delicious.

Raw Mussels - While the flavors are saltier and sharper than an oyster, it also has a crunchier texture.  I didn't like it as much as the oysters and I can go either way on this, but I think I would just get more raw oysters instead.

They give you a fresh baked sourdough roll and butter.  I don't even bother eating it because I want to save room for the food.  However, when I did eat it, it was perfectly baked with the crunchy exterior coupled with a soft and warm interior.  I like their wine selection as well, even if it's not that extensive, but you don't need a big complicated wine list when what they have is picked to work with their food anyway.",1,j7W6t1Bjb3H1vCTtk3wiCA

What we have found in our travels is that Mexican food varies greatly from the Chicago area to North Dakota to Denver and now Phoenix.  I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here.  I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair.  THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage.  Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy,  My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves.  Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream.  THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant.  She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service.  THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking,  Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there,  One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced,  Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices.",1,LvDh4IoBHdtojqZI1G3vrg

I used to come to this location as a preference over all other ones because they are nice and the servings were decent but I just left here and got a two scoop Sunday and either the guy used the wrong scoopers or they use smaller scoopers because my Sunday didn't even fill half the container. I guess this is just another business like all the rest that charge you the same amount of money but give you less. It's a shame the customers are always on the losing end when that happens.

I had a couple rolls they make called the CLT roll and the Captain's Roll which were very tasty indeed. I happen to like spicy...both of these rolls have a common spice in using jalapeño peppers either sliced or diced. In addition, the tuna in both dishes was of good flavor and texture. I should clarify that the Captains Roll wasn't really a roll...it was more of a sashimi with yellowtail tuna in ponzu sauce, with sliced jalapeños on top.

Either way, it was exactly what I was looking for in a lunch. Consider this fact as well that this is a sushi place, IN AN AIRPORT, IN NORTH CAROLINA...not what you are expecting to find down this way.

Prices were reasonable for airport food. The wait staff was both attentive and friendly. Interesting considering that they seemed to be employed by HMS Host and I have had rather unpleasant dealings with that company in the past. Either way, I had a waitress/bartender that did an excellent job of both making recommendations and ensuring I had what I needed to enjoy a great meal..

7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,2,2011-09-22 19:28:51,1,3TaLBTzA_R3spxiNKwiCFA,"Again, this was another location I saw on Food TV that begged me to stop in and gorge myself. All I remembered from the program was a pastrami sandwich piled high enough to scale like a mountain. Things like this are typically enough to sell me on eating somewhere. 

The location is small, and if it weren't for the colorful signage out front, you'd be likely to drive right past it without noticing. I'm going to assume most people drive through since there isn't much parking or seating to be had. But I went on a Monday afternoon, so there wasn't much traffic to worry about. 

They've got a big menu. It's one of those gargantuan menus that has so many options you spend the next 10 minutes second-guessing yourself and drooling over every possible item. I kept getting lost in the damn thing, so I went with what I planned on getting: something with pastrami in it. The Reuben called out to me, so I ordered one up along with a small order of spicy Cajun shoestring fries. 

They've definitely got the best Reuben that I know of in Vegas. The problem is that while eating one, I have no choice but to compare it to others I've eaten... and it gets slayed when stacked up against Canter's (in L.A.) or Katz's (in NYC). But I realize those aren't the most fair comparisons because those establishments are the thing of legend. The sandwich was piled high with a mountain of pastrami hidden beneath a couple slices of crisp rye bread, a generous portion of kraut and some brown mustard. I inhaled it in under 10 min. 

The fries were well-seasoned, but I'm not a big fan of the shoestring variety. They tend to get way too crispy, so it's like I'm eating crispy Chinese noodles or something. I like a big steak fry; something that commands respect on the plate. 

The guys working here were all extremely friendly and patient with how long it took my gf and I to peruse the menu. I need to come back to try their shakes, which are apparently just as worth making the trip as their sandwiches.",2,4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA

Don't get me wrong, I do realize some restaurants go for a certain look, but hear me out for a second. They were all wearing dresses SO close to their rears, that I doubt they would even bend over. Walking in, the interior was EXTREMELY nice, and had me excited to be seated, but then I saw OUR seats. We were seated in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen. Our decor looked about 40 years older than the decor in the rest or the restaurant, and there were only four tables spaced evenly ONE FOOT APART. I was a little disappointed, but thought nothing of it -- seeing as I hadn't scanned the restaurant yet. I was lead to the bathroom by a waiter, and to my surprise the only part of the restaurant that wasn't eccentricly decorated was those four little tables in the back. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I felt like yesterdays shell fish. I felt personally discriminated against for my weight, especially since the other three tables were of people the same size. I felt like we didn't fit ""their mold"", so they just stuck us in the back. I will never, ever, EVER, be coming here again, and will advise anyone not to either.

If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE!  For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera.  The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served.  Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée.  No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold.  Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals!  He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera.  It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing!  My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery.  All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed!  Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals.  We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake!  It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant.  We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections.  They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake.  Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint.  Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant?

So our party including execs had to sit at the 'community table' which my manager was not excited about, thanks, Vig.

Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.

My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.

First, the food... Your run of the mill bar grub -- burgers, hotdogs, fries. You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili. 

Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots! 

Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too. Lots of sleek wood. High top tables and a few seats at the bar. It's teeny-tiny though, so if anything is happening uptown (especially a Knights Game) expect a packed house.

When I visited Gail Knits a few weeks ago, I was in search of a crochet/yarn store in which I could frequent for supplies and advice.  Upon entering, there were tables with knitters having their lunch and knitting their projects, none of which looked up in my direction.  I asked a woman in the back for help to choose a yarn which was for a house slipper project.  She was quite helpful and I learned some things.  But, her tone was neither friendly or negative, it was monotone and uncaring, more towards monotone and ""I could really care less.""  She did invite me to come knit in their store at any time, but I probably will not take up the offer since I felt borderline, unwelcome.  I gave this store 3 stars because her customer service was the bare minimum of what is needed to feel welcome in a ""local type"" store.  Their selection of yarn and knitting supplies are wonderful.  I could not spot any crochet supplies.  I was under the impression it was a strictly knitting environment I had entered.",7,KFBLckGw4Sm8YOo9qIMLPQ

My 2 experiences have been different from what has been mentioned.  Staff were friendly but not pushy, prices were as expected (they are in a high end mall, folks - the rent must be paid) and the tea was fine.  I liked that they would make a cuppa of whatever they sold (rather than ""this is the flavor of the day"") and even though $4.99 is a bit steep for a cuppa, it is a one-time leaning experience and is helpful in learning whether you want to take this tea home or not.  The only warning I might give is that, in one case, they added a bit of rock sugar to the store sample pot of the mixed chai, so it is sweeter than the actual tea that you might buy.",0,hg7NGrA_VN-HnOR5HLYMJg

The boyfriend and I found ourselves in Solon running errands for a friend, and decided to grab dinner there.  Maybe we were in the wrong part of town, but dinner options seem to be a bit limited in Solon.  We chose Pacific East because we love sushi and because we had a decent experience at the Cleveland location.

Upon first entering the establishment, we were turned off by the intense fishy smell.  It was seriously overpowering....I wanted to turn around and leave, but the boyfriend convinced me to stay.  The place was completely empty except for two other customers.  It appears that this location used to be a Wendy's or Roy Roger's, or some other fast-food joint.  It has those curved windows that you often see at said establishments.  The decor inside was pretty plain.

Service was friendly and prompt.  Our water glasses were kept full and our server repeatedly checked in to see if we needed anything.  I suppose this is a benefit of dining in an empty restaurant.

For our meal, we chose to split the ""Bridge for Two"" which contains 14 pieces of nigiri, 22 pieces of sashimi, a spicy tuna roll, and a California roll.  It is served with house salad and miso soup for two as well.  Total cost?  $50.  The miso soup was a tad on the salty side, but still flavorful.  The salad was the typical salad you get a sushi restaurants: iceburg, cucumber, tomato, and ginger dressing.

When our ""bridge"" arrived, it was beautifully presented.  The sushi chef obviously took pride in the presentation.  The amount of fish on it was actually a bit daunting.  The chef did not skimp on the cuts of fish.  The fish on the nigiri was literally hanging off both ends of the rice.  The sashimi was cut into huge slices.  The rolls were completely stuffed with goodies.  I normally don't even like rolls, but I devoured these without a problem.  We were hardly able to finish the entire meal, but didn't want to waste good food, so we made ourselves uncomfortably full.  It was worth it.

The quality of the fish was good, but not great.  While we had much variety, some of the fish seemed a bit dull.  None of it tasted bad by any means, just not as fresh and flavorful as it could have been.  I was quite pleased that the fish was served at the perfect temperature, too.

The service could be faster but there was only one waitress and one hostess/waiter? It was my fault for saying we wanted all the food at the same time. I feel like if the dishes came out as they were prepared, we wouldn't have had to wait ~20 minutes for the food. 

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It had the bar area like Jack Astor's and the booths like Milestones with dim lighting. If you're a sports fan, they position the TV's all around the place so no matter where you're sitting, you can watch the action.

The menu was standard American food (with some Mexican dishes) with similar pricing compared to competitors. We ordered the following items:

8oz. Top Sirloin - $25.49 - Ordered medium rare and it was cooked between rare to medium rare. I was satisfied with the quality of the meat. It could be more tender but you can't expect too much at this price point. The portion of the baked potato it came with was very generous. More generous than any other restaurant I've been to. Same goes for the side of vegetables.

Blackened Basa - $22.99 - Generous layer of guac on top. Dish was flavourable and wasn't overly salty. The only thing I would say to improve the dish is to cut down the level of blackening (is this a verb?). It dries the fish out a lot.

Baked Onion Soup - $8.49 - Liked the flavour of the soup, not overly salty or strong in onion flavour, did not like the thickish layer of cheese on top of it. 

Basa Fish Tacos $16.49 w/ quinoa and arugula salad + $1.99 - I feel like if they used another type of fish, it would taste better. I wasn't a fan of the chipotle honey dressing but I'm biased towards not liking spicy food. I wouldn't order this dish again because the two other mains tasted much better. The salad, on the other hand, was delicious. I liked the dressing it came with.

10 pc. Fryers (Wings) with Signature NY Butter Sauce - $13.99 -The only reason why I ordered this dish was because I was curious as to what this sauce would taste like. It ended up tasting like it was only coated with butter. I was fine with it but I know a lot of people wouldn't be. I find this dish to be not worth the price because the size of the wings were so small. Plus they only give 2 pieces of carrots and celery for one order.

The total came about to $122 incl. tips and taxes for 3 people. Is that too pricey? You be the judge. I would come back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to persuade people to eat here.",0,VTuTxNnmxcbnPsLh_j4JFQ

Prices don't justify their average food and I agree with Eddie that the owner likes to charge for everything extra. One time I asked for some extra pickles and he wanted to charge me 5 dollars (a small container's worth). This is my first time being asked to pay for some extra pickles at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga. 

Another time when I got 8 falafels, I asked the owner for more tahini sauce because one very small container of taihini didn't seem enough to cover all the falafels. He seemed unimpressed and told me that they give only 1 container of tahini for every 4 falafels - proving to himself that he should have given me 2 containers of tahini for my 8 falafels in the first place, instead of just one!

I wanted to separate my experience before I wrote a review. I came from an outstanding gym, Coach J Fitness located in Thornhill. We relocated into the city and so I joined Ultimate. Throughout the year I had repeatedly tried spin with Vlad, one of the owners as well as his more inexperienced staff, palates with Paula also an owner, Abs & A** with Sam, conditioning with Victoria and Vlad, boot camp with Victoria, TRX with both Paula and Barb, and Athlete with Al. Overall it was a frustrating, disappointing year. There was no redeeming value in the spin. Simply put it was awful whether taught by Vlad or one of his employees. There is way more to a spin class than blasting the music to a deafening volume and being directed to stand up, sit down and go fast. The music for the most part had little, if anything, to do with the beat of the spin. Try a spin class at Spynga with Tamar or Casey---there is no comparison. I attempted going 3-4 times a week to the above mentioned choices. My needs were specific to maintaining strength and keeping healthy. Although Victoria was more attentive than others there was little attention to correcting form or the offer of a modification according to a participant's particular needs. Vlad's consistent direction was watch, this is going to be easy ---fast fast fast. No direction or correction on selection of appropriate weights let alone correct form. Paula had a huge following for palates. I cannot comment on the quality of her classes as this is a type of class I know little about. I will say, however, that there should have been a cutoff in the number of participants allowed in a class. It was so tight you were forced to continually bump or kick your neighbour. Speaking of crowding let me address Ultimate's TRX classes. The TRX straps are attached on a bar across the centre of the room no more than 30 centimeters (1 foot) apart. The instructor bellowed from the front of the room with, once again, very little direction. You could not do a single exercise properly given the ridiculously tight space and lack of direction. Try a TRX class with Sari at Philosophy. The class is small with an intelligent cut off. Well planned and unbelievably attended by the careful watch of the instructor, Sari. You will be blown away. There is no comparison. I carefully, I thought, selected this gym because of the variety of class types offered. Throughout the year I asked when Circuit, listed as one of their offerings, was going to be on their schedule? The answer was always not at this time. A whole year passed without Circuit ever making it on to the schedule. Remember please, as I have learned, you get what you pay for. Apparently Ultimate opened charging a monthly annual commitment fee of $190.00. When I joined it had gone down to $140.00. You would have to question why? A boutique gym at Yonge and Summerhill moments to the subway and they had to significantly reduce their rate. Why? I've returned now to Coach J Fitness bringing all my injuries, thank you Ultimate, with me. I am so happy with my return to the club. Immediately all my needs were addressed and modifications were made to also accommodate my injuries with the focus on rebuilding my strength. Don't waste your time or money on this club. The only thing it has going for it is location.",1,BwfPunfc8bMqw1RZ6CzOIA

I stuffed myself like I was living my last day on this earth. The meat came at decent time intervals. I especially jumped at the chicken, bacon-wrapped turkey, and sausage. 

My server, however, was quite cold and rude. She flinched when we mentioned that we had the Tix4Tonight voucher, taking away our menus immediately (what if I had wanted to browse it further?). Instead of giving us tap water, which she did for the adjacent table, she handed us an Acqua Panna bottle ($6.95). Two weeks later, I am still perplexed as to why this happened (I clearly did not say bottled water). She also consistently failed to check up on us, bypassing us as she checked on her other tables. I sometimes wonder why such people decide to go into the hospitality service. Needless to say, her tip was accordingly small.

That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I waffled back and forth on this place, unable to decide if it was worth three or four stars.  I settled on three and a half, and rounded down because it's Monday.  Notwithstanding the rating, I recommend you try it at least once.

After a weekend jam-packed with excitement, Thursday seems so long ago but I remember vividly the group of about 20 of us that gathered to say farewell to FARC and fellow meatatarian Deanna ""if it once ate, I'll eat it at least once"" W.  I arrived late but still had a little time to case the joint before getting a beer* in my hand and my order in.  Gio Rana's is built inside an old bank**, with high ceilings and an open-concept kitchen near the back of the large dining area.  It's not that exciting, save for the Really Really cool private wining and dining room that used to be the bank's vault.

The menu consisted of a sheet of white paper, printed double-sided, in a ratty plastic sheath.  Really Really cheap-looking.  Thankfully, selection was good, and everyone at the table seemed to be able to find something they wanted.  I found lots, and ended up settling on pan-seared scallops with pork belly and jus, pork tenderloin in a walnut and gorgonzola sauce and beet, tomato and goat cheese salad. (these, and two bottles of beer, set me back $60 including a respectable gratuity).

Scallops

My first bite gave me a bit of a foodgasm.  Two scallops, and a healthy dose of pork belly.  They were Really Really big, and perfectly cooked.  Regrettably, a bit of grit (not sure if that's a given with scallops, but I wish it weren't).  The pork belly was a nice nod at the more traditional bacon-wrapping, and the jus was a nice complement.

Pork Tenderloin

Really Really Nice Gorgonzola sauce.  Portion was quite large, and the pork was nicely done.  Found myself mopping up the sauce with whatever I could find around me.  Eventually just picked the plate up and licked it clean.

Beet Salad

Tasty, but unremarkable.  It was what it was and I'd probably try something else next time.  Also, got hit with a giant piece of onion near the end of it that left me with onion-mouth until I got a few pints of draught in me at our next stop.

Service:  

Our group of 20 was handled professionally from where I was sitting.  Deanna's co-FARC Christine ""charfcuterator"" C may beg to differ; sitting across from me the poor doll was elbowed and bumped for most of her time at the table.  Still, we were taken care of and we weren't kept waiting any longer than might be expected for such a large group.

Is Gio Rana's Really Like an East Side Mario's?  Really?

I kinda think so.  It's loud and chaotic, and the décor is equally kitschy.  The service is ""run around like a chicken with your head cut off"" style (but effective) and the place is good for large groups.  

While the food is absolutely delicious, I still feel like I'm getting hosed when I pay 60 bucks at a place that so desperately needs a makeover (or at least a nosejob) and has such horribly cheap-looking menus.

From the moment we walked in and started placing our order, she badvibed us and illustrated a very negative attitude and rudeness towards us. They also ran out of plastic cutlery and I was told that our server would be bringing them to our table. Unfortunately the same lady at the cash brought us our food and failed to bring us cutlery. When I asked for it, she rudely told us ""to get it yourself""
I understand that she might have had a difficult day but she shouldn't have put it on us! She also didn't properly apologize for her terrible behavior.

I had made the reservation a week and a half prior to the day of the party. I called the establishment an hour and a half before the time of the party to double check about a few details. The representative from Flip Dunk informed me that my party started at 4p, not 6p. Obviously I felt terrible that this happened to my son when he was so excited. However, Flip Dunk didn't share my disappointment. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, the representative informed me that I would be able to receive passes to attend another day. So, I pulled it together and took all the kids to the movies to celebrate and informed all of the parents we would be returning to FD at a later date to jump. Did I say I prepaid nearly two hundred dollars? Or that I never received a courtesy conformation call from FD? Or that I was never sent the waiver for children's parents to sign who would be attending the party? So here I am, returning to FD to make up the mistake to my son and his friends. First thing they say is, does everyone have a waiver signed. I flip out, hehe!! but somehow every kid I brought had a waiver on file or their parent was still at FD to sign so their child could participate. Phew! I hadn't expressed my disappointment to the establishment until a child showed up about 30 minutes late. I was using one of the passes that was given to me and this lady (Mallory) steps in and says, is she your child? I said no. Then she said, ""these passes are for family members only"". I then told her, ""no, they are for my sons missed birthday party due to a miscommunication. And I also told her, ""no one confirmed with me about the details nor sent the waiver to be signed by every child's patent prior to the party"". Then Mallory said, ""we don't do that!"" I told her, yeah, because I prepaid, so why would you care about my sons birthday party? You already got your money, of course you don't care.

Basically, imagine you're making nachos, with a variety of different toppings, but instead of chips, you've got a pierogi base (fried, boiled, or half and half).  This is NOT what I was expecting, but I'm not complaining!

2 things I liked: Damn, that Miss Piggy is GOOD.  The sauce is delicious and the combo of the pork, goat cheese and green onion is *praise hands emoji*.  It was the deliciousness of this dish that caused me to beg my boyfriend to return.  The Butter Chicken wasn't AS good, in my opinion, but I still polished them all off in one go.

They serve Polish vodka!  I lived in Poland for 3 years and being able to order a Zurbuwka apple juice (and that the bar even had apple juice!) was the highlight of my visit.

1 thing I didn't: maybe the toppings are to be the focus, but the pierogi themselves aren't anything to write home about.  I've tried both the fried and the boiled, expecting the fried to just be a little bit crispier than the boiled, but they're not like fried pierogi I've had elsewhere at Polish places.

My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert. 

About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry.

If you're on your cell phone and you're looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you've found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you're in the mood for.

Servers are pretty quick here and when it's busy there's a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible.

The decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side.

That said, one of my best friends is a chef here, and he makes sure that we're taken care of with any special requests we might have when it comes to food. That also goes for the rest of the staff; the service is EXCELLENT and friendly (without bias), and they have a couple of cool little promotions going on.

Beers are like $2 a pop; every time you drink a fat tire, you get entered into a raffle for a fat tire bike. Besides, fat tire is delicious. 

The food is actually excellent as well. I've tried more than a few things here, and I've been surprised every time with how good the quality was for a restaurant that's off the beaten track, hence the name. 

There's bar shuffleboard, darts, pool tables. Video poker. Couches, comfy chairs, big screens for watching football/other sports.

That said, it's an ultra-lounge. VIP seating available, dance floor, live DJ and signature drinks. You don't have to worry about people bumping into you on the dance floor like you will on the hottest night clubs. 
The decor is mediocre. The light show is average, but there are some extinguisher blast effects and they hand out party favors (light tubes, bandannas, sunglasses) from time to time, not to mention the infamous cheeseburger cart (with free grub).
It's a casual, social, party like atmosphere. I get the feeling I'm with 150 of my closest friends more than a Vegas hot spot.
We attended free with our hotel key, but I can't imagine them denying you access if you asked really nicely at the front desk. 
I had a single drink from the bar. A long island. Service was speedy and polite, but nothing extravagant. 
Overall - fun, but not mind-blowing.

GBDC - Ghostbar Dayclub - attended Nov 1 2014 for Day of the Killer Costumes and Jan. 24 2015 for Toga Party.
Nov. 1 - The most insane, awesome, fun costume party I've ever been to! 5-stars for this one! Super-packed with tasteful competitive costumes and a friendly environment. DJ and MC were on point. Very well done! Cheeseburger cart - check.

Jan. 24 - My gf and I were 2 of 5 patrons that actually dressed in togas! AVN star, Farrah Abraham was the guest, but she didn't even dress in a toga. If the employees hadn't dressed, it would've been really dumb, but they all dressed out. 
There were gogo dancers and the SWAG guy making sure everyone was having a great time. Cheeseburger cart made another appearance. We had a great time, but wished more patrons had participated. Are we the only ones that know how to party right?

I asked to be pre-approved before I started looking at cars with the understanding that this just might not happen.  They were all friendly and respectful... to my friend who went with me.  He has a mechanics background.  They shook his hand three times.  I was the one buying the car and was never offered this common courtesy. I really try not to be that kind of woman, but... Then they tried to sell me a Mustang that was posted on their internet inventory as clean and ready to go.  It had been driven by the wife of one of the people who work there, with major dents on the roof, a rear bumper that had significant damage, an obvious oil leak, and a questionable CARFAX report.  

They wanted me to make a promise to buy it that they would clean it up and make it ready to go.  We asked that if we were approved for that car and it didn't work out, that the offer would be good for another car of that price.  They said yes. But they wanted me to sign that I would buy that car... hmmmm.  Couldn't test drive it and it had problems...  Well, they brought out the credit guy, who once again talked to my friend instead of me, and shook his hand twice, but not mine.  The numbers did not match what was advertised at all.  There was $1000 added on to the price, now making a car that had a Kelley Blue Book value of $3400 from $6700 to $7700.  They said the higher price was a loan fee.  I was sitting under the sign that said ""We use Kelley Blue Book values to price our cars"".  Obviously not the same blue book the rest of us use.

So opposite and so bad it's almost comical. I much prefer the morning shift, especially on Sunday mornings. Morning shifts, while at times very busy, at least have the decency to provide you with kind, personable, and prompt service. With that, you get great food worth the wait and reasonably priced. More options to choose from. 

On the other hand, evenings provide with with mediocre food with some of the worst carelessness and rudeness I have dealt with in terms of service. God forbid you should order dinner to go, and god forbid you could be served a beverage while you wait as calling in seems questionable due to rude and impatient tones on the phone. The server was noticeably  bothered by a subtle, and patient presence while waiting for an order. Her cookie was more important for her dumb mouth rather than a polite request for a beverage not once, but three times, let alone any hope for a shred of polite decency. I HATE feeling like tipping should even be considered at all just because someone gave you something someone else worked their ass off for.

everything was drenched in olive oil.  i'm sure it was a high quality evoo, but everything pretty much tasted the same - olive oil with tomatoes and capers.

veal was okay, and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers (or whatever those were).

After reading various reviews, we decided on CUT.  I would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  The decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.

We started with the pork belly and Louis Shrimp and Crab cocktail.  They were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  I then had the 10 oz American Waygu (kobe) Strip Steak and my wife had the 21 day aged Filet.  The meat lived up to all of our expectations.  We both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  I would have to recommend splurging for the Waygu steaks or even the Japanese Kobe.  At $80 a steak, the Waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  Don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the Strip.

The reason I can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the ""B"" team.  We could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  He started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  The table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  The sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  It doesn't seem to hard to pour McCallan 15 yr in a glass but I digress.   Then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different Cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until I had to ask someone to get it out of there.  We asked for recommendations and they were lame.  This website did a better job.  My wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said ""Med"".  Where are we?  And then he recommended steak sauces with these fine pieces of meat.  

For the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  The food was amazing and we had a great night, but I will probably try a few other steakhouses in LV before I venture back.",0,9v3TG7C9VxiHNjN8GnkxVw

The dumplings were outstanding with a selection of several meats and styles from rice flour to a flaky pastry crust. The cucumber salad was very good and spiced well. Our favorite was the delicate noodle dumpling filled with spiced pork.

I've lived in various apartment communities and this place is one of the worst I've yet to experience. The front office is bad at best. They're slow to fix complaints and maintenance, while also being unnecessarily condescending and rude in the process. Most of our dealings have been with Todd, and he is borderline incompetent. He seems to know the rudiments of the job, and that's about it. I am actually shocked at the 4 star rating overall, because I can't imagine someone giving this place above a 3 star.

On a more positive note, the location is really wonderful, but it's just infuriating dealing with a front office that doesn't even know you live there. Also, they start a hundred different projects and then don't finish any of them for months. This causes inconvenience like something I've never experienced before. They seem to be building a moat around our apartment building, and we're trying to turn the entire front half of the complex into an old western town with true dirt roads. But I don't think that's their goal. Through and through it just seems like one of the worst managed apartment complexes I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. DO NOT MOVE HERE.

The restaurant is small but decorated with an eye to detail and while there are several tables in a small space they are laid out so that I did not feel encroached on. They have an exclusive table for two on a second level that privately overlooks the restaurant. I definitely want to sit there next time! 

Since this was date night we ordered a bottle of wine from their extensive list. Our friendly waitress presented the wine for a sample for us to confirm and made sure to keep our glasses full during the meal. 

To start I ordered the garlic shrimp which came in a little bowl in a broth which was a surprise but delicious. The boyfriend ordered the clam chowder which was the best clam chowder I have had since San Francisco. I ordered the filet medallions medium, but they came out medium well but were still delicious. I also enjoyed the blue cheese mashed potatoes.

The star of the night was the braised curry lamb shank. I am not usually a fan of lamb but this dish was phenomenal. It was so tender it was falling off of the bone and the curry sauce was light and fragrant. I don't believe I have ever had a steak in front of me and ever envied anyone else's dish - especially not a lamb dish! Unfortunately this wonder is not on the regular menu. 

While I would love to give them a 5 star rating my steak was overcooked and our favorite dish of the night is only available twice a year during restaurant week.

The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.

I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.

The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me.
Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.

Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the ""family pool"" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway.

We all had their Cadillac margaritas, which was good not spectacular - but we were all in the mood to have a few drinks. Had mojito, sangria, and one other drink that I can't remember now. Their drinks are strong and hit the spot.

We had chips and guacamole, tuna tostada, chopped salad for appetizer, then sea bass, filet mignon, shrimp diablo, and skirt steak as entrees with sides of mexican risotto, wild mushrooms, and spinach with jalepeno.

Of course they have to have great guacamole -- it's a standard for Mexican! No?

The Tuna tostada was interesting... it's a tortilla triangle with a thin layer of tuna with some type of sweet glaze. i liked it a lot, but the rest of the table was just OK about it. We all thought the chopped salad was delicious - lots of little chunky veggies and seasoned so it was a tad on the sweet side but enough acid to balance. I'd eat just that for lunch.

Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I think the sea bass was the best. It was steamed in parchment, and was the most moist and flavorful fish I've had in a while. Next time I go back for dinner, I'm going to order sea bass. Both of the steaks were good but it's steak - nothing special in my opinion. My shrimp diablo was good, just a tad salty but great flavors - a little spicy but tasty. I only at two shrimp -- it came with six -- because I was too full by then. The bed of mexican herbal rice that came with my shrimp was really really good. The sides especially the wild mushrooms are a must. The risotto was OK along with the spinach.

Usually, I go for lunch, and it was the first time for dinner, and it was great. The only uncomfortable thing about the meal was at the end, our waiter come to tell us that we only left him $36 in tip which was 15% (I don't tip on the tax) -- which I thought was a bit rude for a waiter to come and tell you that you had only tipped 15%. We all sort of looked at each other and said, OK... we'll discuss it.

Bland...and/or dry... and/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple. 
The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?!

DO NOT GO TO THIS IHOP!

It was average busy and we were seated relatively quickly.  Admittedly we were a big group (10).  Then a few more small groups came in and they asked us to move for a moment, and by moment they meant get up and go back to waiting so they could seat the other groups.  They had plenty of other seating, just too broken up to accommodate our group, but would have been fine for the others had I thought to make an issue of it before we were already up.  

Then we heard the waitress complaining that she wasn't going to waste her time waiting on teenagers.  Admittedly, most of the kids I had with me were teenagers, but I'm in my 50's and was paying (if concern about teenager tipping was an issue).  After 20 minutes I gave up and took my kids somewhere else.

I love the selection that the plenitude of food trucks offers.  However...  Ostensibly, the reason for operating a food truck is to reduce the cost of doing business since you don't have to pay for a building, for wait staff, for utilities, and all the other overhead costs that a traditional restaurant incurs.  You can then pass these savings on to the customer with lower-cost food.  However, the reality is that the food trucks charge MORE than traditional restaurants.  For example, I can get three tacos for $6 or $7 at Chipotle, better yet I can get two tacos around the corner at Pedro's for $3.50, so why would I want to pay $10 for three tacos from a truck?  Are they probably better than my $3.50 tacos?  Sure, but double-the-cost better?  Sadly no, there are not.  I think the food trucks get away with a little overpricing due to the food-truck hype, the novelty, and the fact that mostly all of them seem to have the same relatively inflated prices.  If each food truck was delivering exquisite gourmet delicacies, then the prices would perhaps be perfectly justified but most of them are not.  Most of them are delivering average fare, perfectly acceptable but nothing special or remarkable about it or the ingredient selection.  Given that there are tons of local places nearby serving mostly the same food for less, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay more for the same thing from a food truck.  The novelty of the event has somewhat of a redeeming value.  It certainly serves as an interesting thing to do for lunch to break up the daily M-F routine.  Will I go back?  I'm sure I will.  Will I leave, as usual, wondering at how little food I got for my money?  I'm sure of that, too.",4,1C4RBKxpuIQFOaBw-3brdg

Rooms are massive; you get a living room, a kitchen (full fridge, stove, dishwasher, and microwave), a giant bathroom, and a bedroom. Kitchen has no cutlery/plates/etc but you can request them by calling downstairs. If you're lucky your suite will have a giant jacuzzi (i'm 6'2"" and i fit in like a glove).

I was here as part of a group so internet was included for free (pro-tip: it's always free in the lobby).  As someone who travels a lot the internet was good: it was stable and had adequate signal throughout the suite.  Anyone who expects speedy/cheap internet in a hotel is naive (or hasn't done much travelling). I got strong LTE signal (Rogers) on my phone, so could have tethered too.

Each room night comes with a free drink and complimentary breakfast, alas sleep came over food so i didn't get to try out the breakfast, and didn't care about the drink. Parking is $23/night and includes unlimited in/out privileges: it's a small lot so you might need to park at the convention centre down the street if you're in big SUV (or suck at driving in tight spaces).

THE WINDOWS ACTUALLY OPEN.  Sorry for caps-lock but so many hotels are so concerned about people jumping that they bolt all the windows shut.  My co-worker had a smoking room and was shocked to find the ability to open the window.  The non-smoking rooms have newer/nicer furniture than the smoking ones (and obviously don't reek of smoke).

Only downside is that none of the rooms have a view (unless you count construction and other room windows as a view). Also there are only two elevators that are sometimes so slow they feel like they're being hand-cranked. No free water bottles either.",1,Ip7GdJmVv1Ju0fsol7y5mQ

As it turns out, there are major inconsistencies with specific brand products with respect to quality control.

Also disappointing was the bulk-sliced white cheddar cheese, albeit the ""lite"" variety, which had a synthetic and bitter quality all it's own.  It also had sticky paper in between each slice which may be a problem for sight impaired or the elderly.

He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking.

It was a little pricey but the food and service were worth it. I think this is by far the best ""special occasion"" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. 

We started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The ""Great Fruit"" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the ""SKOCU THU"" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. 

As for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.

The $9 well drinks and $7 domestic beers were fine as long as you got them free at the tables and not the terrible bars. The showers were fine except the leaking fixtures and sandpaper towels.

That's the room here. Walls are paper thin (possibly worse than my college dorm). Water pipes/drainage in bathrooms from adjoining rooms sounds like they're gonna flood my room. Convention/Meeting rooms: Uhm, it got the job done? Gym: lol. Not a gym. Smelled like mold/must. Terrible equipment. Dbs up to 50 (nothing new here). Venue: it's on lake Las Vegas for Pete sake...you don't have to do much here...

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while.",2,WYU7YDh9u7tr__XGRwj3ZQ

The cheese curds are quite possibly the best in the business and the fries are always cooked perfectly.  But with all of that good comes some bad.  The fish is overpriced and just ok, I expect amazing when I'm paying $12+ for fast food fried fish. I'd pay $7 for it any day but never again at $12.

We met Bruce at an open house, where we found him to be approachable and knowledgeable of the area. He was helpful in narrowing down areas that would meet the requirements for our search, as we wanted to be close to work and schools that our children were attending. He quickly found us a beautiful house that met most all of our realistic needs and wants. He was very helpful in negotiating and guiding us through the process, as it is a bit different than other areas of the country we had owned. Answered ALL of our questions and when he did not have an answer, went out of his way to find what we needed to know. Never thinking twice for perhaps some of our odd questions, like about scorpions and desert living.

Very easy to deal with, supportive and always seemed available for us.  Even after the closing, he checks in on us to make sure that we have what we need and are happy with our decision.

My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money.",2,TQ1ddpjftd7-viE_CV8dqw

This Pei Wei is by my work and the first time I went there with coworkers everyone else got their food and my food didn't come. Finally I asked what had happened to my food and the person said that they made it with chicken instead of shrimp, but they never asked me what I would like to do. They just assumed I would rather wait than eat a different protein, but it was a work lunch hour, so not the choice I would have made.

Today I needed to run an errand at lunch right by the Pei Wei. I went early so I could order and pay before the rush but wanted it ready to pick up in 20 minutes. After three people tried to delay the order, the store manage said they couldn't do it and I would just have to come back and place the order then. 

I knew it would. E too long of a line then and not enough time and I was incredulous that this was his suggestion and asked what they do when someone calls in an order and he said they can do it then. So I said that if I were calling they could do it but since I was standing in front of them, they couldn't. He agreed and said I could either call or come in later. I told him I would just go somewhere else. He seemed annoyed and reiterated that his computer wouldn't let him do it. 

If it were me, I would have taken the order and money and just told my cook line to not make that order and then in 15 minutes tell them to make it. It's not that difficult when you make customer service the priority.",3,aXuADtwWImTx87Sl4kK68A

Absinthe is a 90 minute show located in a permanent circus tent outside of Caesars Palace near Hell's Kitchen. There's a beer garden-esque waiting area before you enter into the tent. Every seat in the house is a good one. Grab a first or second row seat if you're hoping to be called out or called up on stage. If you're happy to be a bystander and are looking for the best seats in the house, I recommend row K. Rows A-J are all tightly together and then rows K and L are spaced out on raised seating in the back. I think you'd get the best view from Row K.

It had the perfect amount of veggies, it didn't compensate for a lack of protein at all, there was plenty of bulgogi to be eaten in every bite.

Service was excellent - a server would bring out our meals, then our main server came over to tell us the dish ingredients, cooking style etc.

DRINKS:
Sauvignon Blanc, Eradus (for me) - more on the sweeter end, which I preferred. 
Pinot Grigio, Serenissima (bf)

APPETIZERS:
PAN SEARED SCALLOPS (3/5)
(Seasoned with curry salt, green apple purée)
The scallops were seared perfectly - very delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple purée was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!

MAINS:
DUCK CONFIT (4/5)
(With wild mushroom risotto)
Mm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. 

PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)
(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)
For those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. 

DESSERT: 
TOFFEE CAKE (5/5) 
You would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake. So good - there was a crunchy glazed toffee on top of the vanilla ice cream and the toffee cake is at the bottom. I would come back again just to order this dessert.

I like a one stop shop, and Butcher's Market gives you just that, in local products. They have everything from beautiful cuts of meat to craft beer, to veggies and pimento cheese. Everything is always fresh and you can tell that they've put thought into their selections. The cuts are the best of the best, but they're happy to tell you what are second and third best - if you're looking for something more in that price range. You can find cheese in the back - I'm back on a pimento cheese kick, and they have Pasta & Provisions products in the freezer!

They have a very large selection of craft beer for a store of this size, and you'll often find not only food samples, but beer samples as well! I love seeing the hyper local regulars - Bird Song, OMB, Unknown, along with some state wide NC breweries. 

The staff is super helpful and friendly, they'll assist in answering any questions and even tell you how to cook/marinate/smoke/prepare the foods that they sell should you need any guidance (I usually do.). They're always grilling something outside on Saturdays, and this has a very strong potential to change your meal plans. I've come in here a handful of times sure that I was looking for marinated chicken, and walked out with steak instead. haha - who's surprised? No one. 

They are a higher priced butcher, but I feel like it is definitely worth it for one-on-one assistance from staff and the quality of meats and foods that you can purchase here. If you want big box store kind of help, go to a big box store. If you want a little more attention to detail and a larger local selection, go to Butcher's Market.",7,QLgFEumhrHq6LgbEOKCzdw

IMLrj2klosTFvPRLv56cng,1,2014-08-19 23:10:56,1,eigKhUsrgtglY3k6EGFQfg,"Went here for dinner based on the reviews and overall I found that the food was very good, but it is really overpriced.  I noticed numerous other reviews say the same about the prices.  One lady I saw said she did NOT think it was overpriced, and quoted that she paid $35 for 1 entrée and 1 appetizer at lunch.  You don't think $35 for a lunch with appetizer is overpriced?  Man, I wish I could live in that world.

The stuff we had was typical ""high end"" fare...exotic sounding ingredients in small, well presented portions.  For 2 people for dinner, we had 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 1 entrée, and 1 dessert...no wine/drinks of any sort and the bill was $100 flat including tax without tip.  The prices need to come down about 20% in my opinion, although I could live with 15%.  As it stands, we really enjoyed the food but it isn't the kind of place we will justify going back to any time soon.  I like great food and I have no issues spending big money on great food, but it is just too overpriced, even for an overpriced haute cuisine type place.

The grilled octopus appetizer was very good.  A nice char with a good blend of flavors from the romescu, potato and avocado, but at $16, it was about $4 too much.

The prawn appetizer was tasty, although they were overcooked.  Also, 4 large prawns in a flavored broth is a bit much at $15.  

The free range chicken breast entrée was very good as well.  It came with a little portion of their tasty mac and cheese, with chile and white cheese (cheddar I believe).  Cripsy on the outside and pretty juicy inside.  Very good, but again, at $23 for 1 large breast and some mac and cheese, it is about $4 too much.

My wife had a nice little peach salad, which was good, especially since peaches are in season.  It consisted of 1 peach, halved, then topped with some kind of cheese and nuts and some other items.  Not exactly a massive serving, and if I remember correctly it was $14 or $16.  1 peach...cut. in. half.  Come on.

The one thing that I felt was pretty fairly priced was the dessert.  I had a peach pie, which came with a nice scoop of ice cream, and it was a pretty decent sized serving, and for $9, it was pretty on point I felt.

Also, they have a delicious little bread basket which is on the house and they even refilled it, so obviously I appreciate that there are other house costs like the free bread that have to be covered, but at these prices you better eat a few baskets.  Not hard to do mind you, especially with the tasty little mix of butter, salt, honey and olive oil they provide.

Overall, the food was great and we had no issues with the service as some others have described.  However, at $100 pre tip with only house water to drink and $118 with tip for 2 people and only ONE entrée and 1 dessert, it was just WAY too much.  $85 pre tip would be acceptable, $75-80 would be better.  Would I return?  Sure...but not anytime soon and probably only on rare occasions.  For that kind of money, they are other places I enjoy and other places I want to try, so I just can't justify working into any kind of regular rotation.",1,8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ

Patti and Dave, owners, are always very helpful when customers ask about a game. There are always people playing games in the store and, when a customer asks about a game, Patti will usually find someone playing who knows the game and can answer the customers' questions.

Approximately one-third of the store's square-footage is devoted to tables for customers to meet-up and play games or for one of the tournaments the store hosts. On any given day, you can find people playing board games, role-playing games, miniatures, card games (e.g., Magic or Netrunner). There are no video games sold at Game Depot. My husband often brings our children, ages 10 and 7, to the store and they often find another child or two to play games with.

The store keeps a good variety of games in stock, but they can and will order just about anything you want. Several game designers and game distributors come through the store frequently, and they are happy to help Dave and Patti get copies of hard-to-find games.",2,5etoH93OqkQUyqEjs_nsHg

One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.

This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.

We split the steak sandwich and avocado egg rolls for the rest of our lunch and enjoyed those as well. A chill environment during the day time when we were there.

Made reservaton for 3 PM Mother's Day, but no need, as Rokerij was not on the collective conscious MD list and thus plenty of open tables. The entertainment lawyer from LA turned waiter 4 months previous seemed quite pleasant and pleased to be in his new role and will only become more refined and astute. Just don't bring up Guns N Roses around him...

(Throughout we were attended to by other friendly staff who seemed to get along well with each other, carrying on light banter within ear shot.)

A gentle reminder to all establishments as we enter the ""warm"" season, please keep a vigilant eye on our water glasses. Sometimes even 30 seconds of ice only at the bottom of a glass can cause mild anxiety.

There were 5 different, occasionally overlapping menus (Rokerji's own lunch, breakfast, dinner; Dick's Hideaway; Richardsons) on the table, as well as colorful chalkboards on the walls full of specials. Choice overload.

We settled into a nice, earthy Firestone cab for me, bellini cocktail for my love, homemade lemonaid for teen daughter, and tea for mother-in-law, followed by calamari and tomato bruschetta for pre meal. All eliciting satisfying, ""Mmmm's!"" from a family not known for the gift of describing presentations and flavors in poetic, food critic terms.

Main courses were blackened Mahi w/ beets and trout w/ green beans (2 separate specials from the board) Pasta Heidi, chicken,beef,shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. we all shared, compared and enjoyed. 3 of the 4 dishes are on the spicey good side.. The trout was purposely tame for wife's mother.

Passed up dessert because someone in the party was jonesing for Costco's strawberry swirl and I was set on buying one of those propane tanks with a gauge (refer to pre-Mother's day grilling malfunction); my reward for pulling off - for the first time in a few years - a successful Mother's Day outing.

Thanks, Rokerij. Hope to see you again soon.",0,BMmqlIKNesbCEav3yqML-A

The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.

I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).

I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.  They do have an excellent draft beer selection and I found that tasted better with the oysters.  The next time I go I am just going to order oysters and beer and it will be a 5 star experience.

I'm not sure if it's the almonds, the crunchy sugar bits, or the custard intermingled with cake, but the combo is a delightful treat. However, beware the other burnt almond tort items just aren't as good as the original. 

Burnt Almond Torte Bar - this is shaped like a log. It's the perfect combo.

Burnt Almond Torte Cookie - it's crispy but lacks the custard feel.

Burnt Almond Torte Cake - we were advised to buy the cake when I asked to walk away with 4 bars. The cake was good but the ratio of ingredients is off. The middle of the cake lacks the crunchies that you get with the bar.

Walking Burnt Almond Torte - this is the newest concept. I'm not sure if I just got an old one. It was the last one in the fridge advertising for these new tortes in a cup. It's pretty much a dry, stale parfait. The layers are packed super tightly into a cup. You have to dig through what seems like an endless clump of cake before you get to custard. It's a miss. Stick to the bar.

The only other Burnt Almond Torte item left is the cupcake. I haven't tried it yet. It looks great with a generous dollop of custard. This item should be a winner but if you want a guarantee pick the bar.

I've also tried their cheesecake which is typical of your standard NY cheesecake. It's simple, solid cheesecake option. No frills solid bakery.

If I lived nearby this would be an easy to-go repeat. The food and options were tasty; I loved the paneer (they gave me a lot and I was sooo excited about it) and the Tikka sauce was good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the naan, but they don't bake it in house- which is normally the draw for me anyways. It's priced a little high for the concept.

Unfortunately, our waitress was on her third day on the job so service was poor.  She and the manager even apologized for that.  But, everyone is new to a job at least once and, as a former restaurant worker, I tend to be quite forgiving.  Whenever I go to a new ""ethnic"" restaurant I usually order one of the ""baseline dishes,"" because if these dishes are good the rest of the menu items are also usually good.   Here I did a taco and a cheese enchilada combo.  First, I couldn't get ground beef even though the waitress told me ground beef was an option, instead I got big chucks of shredded beef in the taco.  The pieces were dry and tough, so as I bit into the taco shell I ended up with a huge hunk of beef hanging out of my mouth with a little piece of shell.  Not at all good.  Most disappointing, though, was the complete lack of ""zing"" in any of the food I had.  Everything was bland, bland, bland, even the salsas served at the beginning of the meal were lackluster!  I could not taste any cilantro or jalapeno in anything!  Mexican food is supposed to have a little kick in it, but not here.  Even Taco Bell has more spice and flavor than Gecko Grill.  My wife ordered a Seafood Grande with the sauce on the side as she is extremely sensitive to any level of spicy food.  Turned out there was no sauce in this dish but the burro was covered with melted pepperjack cheese because that's too hot for her.  She sent it back and ordered a shredded beef chimi.  The staff did get that out fairly rapidly.  While my wife liked this dish, she did admit that the chucks of shredded beef were very dry and not until she poured some of the liquidy bean dip on the meat was she satisfied with it.  I tasted some of the beef and it was very dry, just as in my taco.  Also, she got a little cup of salsa fresca with her chimi but thought it was more like pico de gallo.  I tasted it and it was so oniony that I actually spit it out into my napkin.  YUK!  The onions tasted as if they had been soaking in the pico de gallo for several days.

My association with the relocated Dixie/Dundas Value Village began in January 2017, when I was invited to a pre-opening event because of my status as a Club Card member. It was a bit of a surprise walking in for the first time - the place was absolutely sprawling. From what I gathered at the time, this location is twice as big as the previous site across the street near the Talize.

The whole corner block has quickly turned into a hub for thrift stores - this site is now directly across the street from the Salvation Army and Talize (both of which I've spoken about in previous reviews). After visiting this Value Village frequently for the past three months, I'm confident in saying that this is now my new favorite in the city.

(As an aside, for those complaining about the lack of finds - this store was, and will continue to be, a prime target for resellers. At the pre-opening event, I watched a man run to the records section and immediately start hoarding a stack of LPs, most likely destined for eBay. It's the nature of the beast.)

The store is a bit overwhelming. Not only are there racks upon racks of clothing, but the specialty sections are surprisingly well-curated. I always make a beeline for the books whenever I come in, and I've been consistently surprised by the quality and selection of books. A thrift store is only as good as the donations it gets, and I've been impressed with the amount of content they get in. The vintage/collectible books section consistently has stuff that looks either brand-new or being sold at a significant loss (i.e. Folio Society books, signed books, Penguin collectible titles). The clothing itself is another high point - I've found everything from Brooks Brothers to Hugo Boss suits here, and a dizzying amount of shoes, jeans and other accessories.

Of course, the knick-knack section runs into the same problem as any other thrift store. Picked over and filled with broken or unusable items. To their credit, though, I almost always see employees restocking whenever I visit. I'm a bit more comfortable paying higher prices for thrifted goods when I know the selection is well-maintained and highly curated.

This Value Village has quickly turned into one of my favorite spots in the city to go thrifting at, and it's one I plan on visiting frequently for a long time to come.

Well worth checking out.",3,Jb13QyXGi0zD4ZtSTBQwpQ

You point to the one you like (mixed greens with salmon or shredded chicken or other meat toppings or fruit & nut) and pick the dressing you want. If you don't like the ones they premade, you can order from their menu. They also have panini and other non salad items, which I haven't tried. 
You don't know the price of the premade salads until you get to the cash. Salads range $9-11 ish. You can help yourself to croutons, sunflower seeds and one more thing (I forgot) for your salad at the cash register. I have only tried their premade salads. They are huge and you actually feel full for the rest of the day.
The people are curt; don't expect smiley greetings. Also, their nuts in one of the salads tasted and smelled really, really old. Other than that, a reasonably priced healthy option in that world.",0,uDPgnEv6jZa4CSv6NX49TQ

We were sat at the wrong table, the rose was on a table I did not pick, the candle was not lit.   and we were sat against the windows where the sun was in our eyes so then we had to switch seats and place our backs to the windows.   Now a good start but lets move on..   

Food was spectacular,   I highly recommend the truffle ravioli. (I almost licked the plate)   The server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the food.  I hate that I cant remember his name to give him credit.   ( upstairs july 27th shaved head )

Overall excellent experience except for the fact that I took the effort to come in and pick out a table away from the windows so the sunlight would not be in our eyes and that I gave fairly specific instructions as to how I wanted the rose on the table and candle lit as we sat.    

Next time I will have the host repeat the instructions. 

--side note-- it was restaurant week, and there were only 4 tables for me to choose from when I showed up at 11am,  I chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seating time so we could make it to the theater at 730pm.

Book a tour in advance, this is the only way you can visit the museum. You can book student tickets online just be sure to bring your student ID with you when you visit. Our tour guide was so nice, I have her to thank for leading us to the Container Park which is located on Fremont and 7th, a five minute walk from the casino madness also on Fremont and 4th. 

Las Vegas is full of history, most of it has been forgotten due to old hotels being taken down and rebuild by new owners and developers. The folks at Neon Museum do their best in getting their hands on as many Neon signs as possible in hopes to preserve them and hopefully to restore them back to life. You'll learn all this and a lot more if you visit the Neon Museum and go on the tour. The one thing I wish was that they'll let you take photos after or before the tour, but because there are so many tours one after another they don't let you. Super clean and cute facility. 

Nevada recognizes the Neone Museum's efforts in preserving Las Vegas's history and now has their back and helps them out every way that they can. One way they help out is by renting them their land for $1 a year so they can use the money from ticketing, the gift shop, and donations towards running the museum and preserving these marvelous pieces of art. The passion and love from the entire staff is touching, you just know you're visiting a place that is important to the state. There were more locals than tourists on our tour, which tells me it has more cultural significance than tourism... you can also rent out a private lot in the back for weddings or private events. 

Tickets are extremely reasonably priced. $18 for adults and $12 for students. Parking is free. It's a private non profit.

Tips: We went on a day time tour at 3pm, we kind of wish we had booked it a little later around 4pm due to the heat. There are umbrellas they will loan you for free for your tour, you leave your ID with them in exchange. Family friendly. Only a few of the signs work at night, the photos come out better during the day time. Walk in is ok, but they recommend booking in advance, depending on how booked the tours are you could walk in and hop on a tour or they might book you for the following day.  If you want to expand your neon experience visit Fremont and be sure to goto the Container Store, The Writers Block, and check out the Downtown Podcast.",4,0-9YVzOkL51P7rtlaLBp9g

Ordered:
x BANG-BANG SHRIMP (rock shrimp | iceberg lettuce | rosemary ranch) - Refreshing dish and beautiful presentation! Crunchy, a little sweet AND a lottle spicy :)
x BLACK RICE (fresh calamari | lobster | saffron | squid ink) - MUST ORDER!!!! This dish was SOOO GOOD! Rice was cooked perfectly and the moose thingie mixed with everything made it 100x better. Seriously, order this or I'm blocking you for life!
x STEAMED MUSSELS (shallots and garlic | brandy | natural jus) - flavorful mussels with generous portions. I thought it was a little under cooked, but thought it was still delicious.
x LOBSTER EMPANADAS (puff pastry | lobster | cheese) - probably my least favorite thing, but I'm not really a fan of fried stuff to begin with so I'm biased. The boo wanted it so got it. Nice kick to each bite and good flavors.

I ""won"" a $50 voucher from one of there contests, I was able to get 2 drinks, a daily special and an upgraded burger and 2 deserts.  The food is the chefs take on things and every time I get something new there is a ""what is this"" moment.

It has all the famous golf holes from Scotland.  First off the when I drove up to the gated course it gave me impression of a private course.  The service was impressive and the guys work quick to get me teed up without delay.   Again on par with a country club. 

The course is in great shape and with no houses or building visible from the courses you almost forget your in Las Vegas.   Fairways are rolling with deep bunkers strategically located to catch missed shots.  However if you look at the course map you can get around these with well placed shots.  The sides of the fairways are hilly and have that long grass as hazards.  The fairways are pretty wide open so making it onto the short grass is very possible for most of the round.   However the rolling hills throughout course adds challenge to the middle of the fairway shot.  But it's straight forward traditional golf which I like best!  

The greens where fast, fast and true!   They broke like they should and required the right touch. Like the fairways they also had some ups and downs you had read before making your putts. 

All in all a very fun golf course and one I would play again on a future trip to Vegas.  If you played a lot of desert courses and want to try something different this is the ticket.   And it's a great way to get a taste of the Scotland experience.",0,9LTX9tC5iwT-s-7Ner7joQ

We met up for brunch today; there were about 10 of us and other than that, the place was dead. There was just an odd, empty vibe to the place, cute decor was still there, but it looked kind of dirty/disheveled. 

They were out of tons of stuff, drinks were slow to be refilled, empty plates left on the table for a long time, etc. it was just odd-- like you could see leftover Christmas paper on your way back to the bathroom, the bathrooms weren't particularly clean,  my friend got a salad without dressing and it ended up being because they were out of salad dressing, but no preemptive attempt was made to correct it before she complained. Whenever we attempted to voice a minor concern, the waiter indicated that it was all due to poor management?

Sometimes service is slow with a big group, but this went beyond that. It was very, very odd.

I originally started with Dr. Woodard but after the second year, he retired and sold his practice to the fast talking, quick moving Dr. Cooper. My original prognosis was for 2 to 2 1/2 years. I opted for clear ceramic and paid $500 extra. Well worth the cost for a slightly less noticeable mouth. Wait times in the office ranged from just a couple minutes to over an hour based on staffing. The office always seems unstaffed and everyone over worked. Scheduling appointments was easy in person and on the phone but rescheduling could mean a delay of a month! Kudos to Tammy and Becky. 
When I asked Dr. Cooper why my treatment was taking so long, he explained he wanted the outcome perfect and didn't want to take me out of my braces until it looked right.

Overall conclusion: I wouldn't pay that price if I just want a nice place to stay, and if I want a luxury hotel I expect more knowledgeable and helpful staff, and a greater attention to detail. So, although overall I had a mostly pleasant time I don't expect to be back.

Details of my stay: I'd booked the junior suite but was offered a good deal on an upgrade to the full suite, which I did since the bathroom in the junior was really not that luxurious looking or feeling. 

Unfortunately the light-blocking curtains in the bedroom wouldn't close all the way. Since I didn't discover this till I fell into bed about 2am I didn't realize how bright it would be. At 6am I was awake and couldn't get back to sleep, so I was exhausted the next day and already regretting the upgrade.  At breakfast I asked the front desk to fix the curtains but by evening they still had not. I couldn't find anybody at the spa any time I stopped by, and I left a voicemail which was never returned. I had to follow up on both and discovered the spa had tried to call back but the voicemail had never been set up for my room so they could not, so the only time left free by then was in the middle of dinner time, not the next morning when I had wanted. The phone in the master bedroom was also completely broken and maintenance had to replace it. And extra 3 bathrobes were confusingly misdelivered to our room, so someone else must have been annoyed.

The ""spa"" is a single room off the fitness equipment area, with one bed and one chair for manicure/pedicures, plus a sauna/steam room in the changing room. One single person staffs it (not a hotel employee, I think; seemed like an external contractor) which explains why there's never anybody at the main desk.  Having just the one person and one bed/chair meant that we two people had to sit and wait for each other half an hour at a time which had not been made at all clear until we got there, which was annoying. I ended up canceling my pedicure just so we could be done in time to eat dinner before 10pm.

The suite was nice, but gave the feeling that hotel management hasn't actually tried STAYING in the rooms.  Little things were just slightly lacking, like the bathrooms having no hooks to hang a bathrobe on and no place to put a towel while in the shower, and the TV size being tiny. Vast empty rooms alone do not equal luxury; it's the conveniences and the attention to detail that makes the difference.

Breakfast was passable but what I'd expect from an airport hotel, not what I'd expect in a hotel that bills itself as a luxury location. The worst problem was that I'd asked at the front desk the day before if they had gluten free options for breakfast and the lady there had absolutely no idea, and the breakfast waitress said they had nothing and couldn't do anything.  Very abrupt and unhelpful. This diet is not rare these days, and the total lack of knowledge of the staff and unhelpful attitude about it were very disappointing.

So, not to be totally negative, the beds were very comfortable, the heating/cooling in the room worked well, and the free wifi decently stable. The doormen were helpful, the location is convenient about 4 blocks walk from the Eaton Center, and the downstairs pool and hot tub look beautiful and were enjoyable (it was a bit too cold for us to try the roof hot tubs).  The hotel IS well kept up and looks luxurious although perhaps a bit past its prime.

I requested a refund on the first night's upgrade fee given all the issues, but it was refused in a rambling voicemail.

Off the top of my head I'd suggest the following improvements:
- serious front desk staff training program
- expand dietary options; charge extra to cover the cost if needed, but offer it
- improve the breakfast. Fresher pastries & food. If budget is tight consider adding an omelette/crepe station off to the side for a $5 upgrade. For god's sake stop hiding the tea pots!
- the spa is small and limited. You cannot hide this so stop trying. If people need to plan to have only 1 person in the spa at once then let them plan in advance for that. Make it clear in the hotel information and include the full spa information in each room with the other information, instead of having the spa desk always unattended and needing to ask for the brochure at the front desk 
- add hooks and more towel rails to the bathrooms
- offer fuzzy slippers as well as bathrobes in the suites
- upgrade the TV size in living room
- train housekeeping staff to report things like curtains that will not close, and check phone and appliances daily
- if the spa is unable to leave voicemail, they should alert front desk to fix that",2,PwOr3Jnst2noM37Lm22zmQ
mISfQv_it_TCXpFf4BFzaw,0,2014-08-20 06:02:33,0,bBdXU8di6m5uGdr9fL64Fg,"One of my favourite places to go for a casual drink with friends or to go for a first date!

I've had several separate first dates here and the low-key atmosphere definitely helps get past the awkward first meeting. Most people are super surprised to see such a great bar on Yonge st these days, so it's a real stand out place if you're a fan of places like Bellwoods Brewery. As with Bellwoods, BarVolo brews a lot of their own beers and has an ever-changing menu which is both a good and bad thing. I've had a couple great beers here that I haven't been able to find again because they're always updating the beer list. Sometimes, it's hard to find a beer you like that suits your budget because there are so many options. I'm no beer aficionado but everything I've had there is pretty decent, and the servers are very knowledgeable and can recommend a good drink for you depending on your tastes.

The food is pretty good and it's fun to share the little plates with a date or friends. The charcuterie is decent and is always changing too, depending on what's fresh and available. It's kind of a small place with communal tables as well as small private tables. In the summer, there's more seating on the patio which can alleviate wait times, but in the winter, I've had to wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. But the wait time is usually quite quick -- quicker than you expect. There's also a more casual ""mingling"" area on the upper level by the bar where you can stand while you drink and wait for a table to become available, so it never seems like too long a wait, and the servers are quite good about notifying you in a timely manner.

Really love this place, love that it's away from the predictable areas like Parkdale or Queen west. Will definitely be back.",2,0qA24lu9d-NtCdSaNPc4lw

It's like, our apartment looks expensive and cheap all at the same time (because the paint continuously chips off the doors and what not).

We also do not like that we have to pay for valet trash. $360 a year for a company to throw our trash out is a bit of a waste to us since we don't live far from the trash area. Especially since when we do put our trash out, they don't always take it all (which baffles me. Why am I paying for them to take only most of my trash?).

Other than that, I'd say we like Sardis Place quite a bit. It seems like the new management is really trying to make this place more homey and spiffy. The employees have always been really great to us, and my boyfriend and I are actually a little confused by the other reviews saying that the employees aren't great.

The 2 Bedroom, 2 Bathroom has Washer/Dryer in unit, granite countertops, dishwasher, stove, microwave, fridge. One room has a completely private bathroom, the other has access from the room and from the living area. We have queen beds in our rooms, they fit very comfortably, a king would also fit. My only complaint about the rooms is that there is no fan (in the room or bathrooms) and no overhead light. 

I am a big fan of the kitchen. For an apartment, it has a pretty decent amount of storage. I cook a LOT, so I have a lot of stuff to cook with. I only have 1.5 boxes of kitchen stuff that wouldn't fit (which is amazing to me since I have 17 different pots and pans). 

As far as we've seen, the community has a pool, dog park, and a lot of run around area for kids to play. Our neighbors mostly keep to themselves, and we never see anyone, but it could also be that we work weird hours.

If I think of more, I will keep adding. I hope this helps!",2,x0kOk7unyMfAVX4gt3KS8A

I wasn't expecting much since it's not a dedicated cafe, but wow, their coffee is insanely strong (you can choose between regular and strong-- I chose strong). Bitter, of course, but wonderful. Finally, something to knock out the weakling brews nearby.

The only bubble tea made with fruit instead of a fruit and powder mix is lychee, which is yummy but I wish more of the drinks were made with 100% fruit.  Contrary to another reviewer, I got a lot of tapioca IMO. I don't think there's a *great* place for bubble tea in Champaign, but Coco is good. You can ask to look at their ingredients list, and let me save you the surprise, it is crap. A huge amount of sugar too. 

The only true downsides are that the interior design is bad and some kid thought it'd be funny to sneeze all over the machines and the staff did nothing about it. The design is not the worst I've seen... but it's pretty ugly and pretty obvious that they didn't hire a good designer. It's the floor... And the kinds of light fixtures they have... Especially that awful LED tree... And how the counter and the area behind the counter look. The place doesn't look put together. There's no flow-- only a big box with an ascetic layout and poor decor. You can see what the big end goal was... And it wasn't reached.

For about $12 a head (adults and kids) we had enough pizza and drinks for everyone, and even wings and a couple of pitchers of beer for the grown-ups. The price even included ice cream, which went well with the cake I brought. Go for the extra token deal (100 for $20). It's hard to have too many tokens in a situation like this.

Food quality is about what you'd expect in an arcade that sells pizza. Nothing to complain about, really.

This location sometimes gets a few bad mentions for the clientele. We were there mid-afternoon on a Saturday and anyone used to a diverse central-city crowd wouldn't have been put off by any customer in attendance. Service was pleasant and and well-experienced. Our server knew how to stage things sequentially, which was appreciated.

About the only downside is parking. You might need to park between the pad which houses the place and the remnants of Tower Plaza instead of directly in front. Not a big deal.",2,vBSzgSvcawxtaDuIdi9hCA

The ladies were super nice and very helpful! They have a daily feature menu as well as a standard menu, the options are a little limited but I would expect that from this type of establishment, that being said, it isn't lacking in any type of way if you're into this kind of fare.

The hospital lacks basic cleanliness (open drywall damage, improper cleaning of floors, sinks and tubs). 

The hospital does not offer many basics that other hospitals offer. Wifi, access to the internet.

In the birthing center,  they overtly say they do not support the mothers birthing partner. No bed, no couch, no chair. There is a bench, but it is in such poor shape and lacks cleanliness. Also, no pillow or blanket for the birthing partner. 

Furniture in the room is extremely dangerous for anyone holding a baby. One Chair broke to pieces when sat in (weight jokes aside, she was 180 lbs maybe).  The second chair in the room, was in similar shape. 

House keeping will not clean your room. They come at 3am to empty garbages only. Once they woke us up to comment on our garbage after it wasn't changed in 24 hours.

This is a teaching hospital, which seems to translate to: focus on the teaching, look what's happening with the patient. The care was good, don't get me wrong. But we were made to felt like if we tried to make my wife's care a first priority we would pay later. 

The induction facilities are horrible in comparison to other hospitals in the province.

You have to pay for supplies for your care, while in care. 
Your have to pay for diapers while in care. 

Family and friends are not able to even sit in the waiting room prior to an after hours birth. (Our biggest gripe)


At the end of our stay, we received a package asking us if we were a grateful patient (read: give us a donation). 
No we were not grateful. We did what we had to to get through their issues and enjoy the birth of our son.

We first stopped in just to look, and then were instantly sucked in by the pizza right by the front door. It was SO GOOD. Maybe it was the serious hunger that was taking over our group at that point, but it was delicious. 

The casino here was excellent.  While stuffing our faces with pizza, we noticed the ""$5 Blackjack, All Day, Every Day"" sign.  Blackjack was our game, and we couldn't believe that $5 tables existed.  ALL DAY.  We noticed that many other hotels began the morning with minimums at $10, then raised them during the day.

I wanted to write this review to specifically thank the manager that assisted us that day (June 21st).  The casino was busy, and we were walking around aimlessly for the $5 tables. We stopped to ask someone to direct us to the area where these tables were. We assumed we were going to get a quick point in a direction, but that we did not.  A manager (I'm sorry if that's not what they are called- the ones in suits who stand behind the dealers is who I'm talking about!) took the time to walk us ALL THE WAY over to the tables.  He engaged us in conversation the whole way over, and when we got to the tables he discovered that there was not 4 open seats for us to all play together.  He made his way over to an open table, a $15 blackjack table, and had the dealer let us all play for $5!  I was amazed at how kind this man was to us.  I did not catch is name unfortunately, but he was a shorter man who was bald and wore glasses! When there are plenty of gamblers spending WAY more money than we were, we were so impressed to receive this kind of service.

Amber is hands down amazing! She's a skilled perfectionist and I am blessed to have her here in Vegas. Finally someone who knows their stuff! She even lets me know of her process in an informative manner and definitely takes her time with me until I am satisfied to a T (my first mani/pedi session with her took about 4 hours due to my pickiness, so I am eternally grateful of her patience with me).

My first and second visit have exceeded my expectations so far. Usually when I set up an appointment I would do both my mani and pedi. You can always text Amber and Ashton (both are lovely and professional in their own way) for inquiries or set up and appointment on their website, its that easy, no frills. Because they're pretty established though, it would be best to book at least a month in advance since the bookings on the website tend to fill up quickly. 

On my first session with Amber I wanted a rose gold chrome with a marble style design. It was definitely a challenge for her but in the end everything was golden with her attention to detail and I absolutely LOVE how the color complimented my skin tone. For my second session, I opted for a classic white marble nail design but with a touch of foiled silver to give it a refined and polished look. Needless to say I got compliments on both of them from friends and family, both genders included yay!

The diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.

I dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\

When I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)

I don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. 

They recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.

One repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). 

Don't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   

It's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

They did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.

I just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.

1/1/16 Update:

No problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!

I would recommend this place to a friend for sure!",2,sev8XAmqrsQeCVZUMk693w

Great prices for beer, friendly and hospitable staff, and a good escape from shitty college kids seeing as I'm a 26 year old freshman. 
The menu for the most part seems very typical for a bar and grill. That being said, you must try their wings, which are all-you-can-eat on Mondays. Perfectly breaded and still gives a good crunch, without becoming soggy with the sauce. The Spicy BBQ is not spicy in my opinion, but has a real good chipotle flavor. The tequila smoke wings are strong on the lime, like a smokey margarita. The Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon wings are good, you can definitely taste the bourbon, but honestly I could not detect the maple very much. YOU MUST TRY THE SWEET AND SPICY JAMESON WINGS, THEY ARE AMAZING. The manager made me try his ""Ultimate Sauce,"" which is their spiciest, but not anything you can't handle, it is not a ""gimmicky"" hot, and it has great flavor.

Food: For the starter I had the Shrimp Toast, the shrimp on top was sweet/sour/spicy but a bit too much. The pancake however was stuffed with shrimp and very tasty. My friend got the Penang Chicken which she liked but the Shrimp Toast was better.  We also ordered their classic slaw with salmon sashimi off the a la carte menu and it was delicious. It's a huge portion of 19, fresh ingredients with a light dressing. However, it was $12 extra for only a few pieces of fish. For mains I ordered the Pan Seared Halibut. The fish was okay but I liked the turnip cakes a lot. My friend tried the Duck Confit which was tender and flavourful, I wish I had ordered that instead. For dessert, you get a trio of Strawberry Rhubarb Compote with chia seeds, Coconut Panna Cotta and a Brownie. The compote was probably my favorite, while the brownie was nothing special.   

Drinks: I had the Shanghai 75 which was fresh tasting with cucumber and ginger while my friend had the White Orchid which was sweet with lychee and more boozy on the tongue. Both of the drinks (and all of the food) was presented beautifully. 

Service: Our server was professional and happy to provide us with suggestions for food and drink. All of the courses were timed perfectly and we never felt rushed. 

Atmosphere: The restaurant is beautiful decorated, a bit on the formal side with dim lighting and tons of Asian influence. I would highly recommend for a date.

The restaurant did not have a lot of frills, rather basic decor, but the food is very good. I had chips and guacamole to start, and the chips were perfectly crispy without being greasy. The guacamole was fresh, and well-balanced with heat and acid. I had the fish baja tacos, and they were very good as well. I loved the avocado salsa.

My friend and I also ordered a pitcher of the original margarita. It was fantastic. No sour mix!! Just tequila (and a lot of it), agave, and freshly squeezed lime juice. These margaritas are very drinkable, but be forewarned, they do pack a punch. I went back to my hotel room after lunch and proceeded to take a nice long nap.

I highly recommend Hussong's as a fun place to stop for lunch if you're in the mood for good tex-mex.",1,xsZ4s7a4MaBIh48MdMkkPw

I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!

My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.

The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.

My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag.

The stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole ""St.Laurent Street"" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 ""bottling fee""  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.

This has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front.

This place it right next to the Thirsty Parrot and if it wasn't for the Parrot's patio I know that Wilbert's would be the place to be for everyone. 
Either way this place has an exceptional draft selection 9 times out of 10 for a reasonable price. Before any game, they have $2 domestics and $3 Jameson's. Hard to beat.
Their bar tenders are friendly and when not too busy they are good guys to chew the fat with. 
Food isn't outstanding but its good and fair. And not to mention they are generous on their ingredients. 
But the best thing that they offer is their live music. They always have good acts coming through putting on a shows whether it's a backed house or playing in front of 6 people.

I'm glad we found this place and hope that others realize how special it is as well.",0,RP09Z1xpzd_J909hLRvlyw

OK, so it's 4:30 pm on a Friday but the hrs on the front door state it's open till 9 pm so why let your shift change affect your customer service.

The biggest selling point is you can customize your treat to your liking, at your own hand. There's no saying, ""Can I get extra sprinkles on that?"" -or - ""Can you mix the strawberry, chocolate obsession AND the Island Mango in my medium cup?"" Since it's completely self-serve, there's no one to judge what decisions you make. The choices are yours. 

I encountered a great selection of flavors and toppings, a friendly and helpful staff, and an expanded waistline. I wish we had Sweet Frog in Philadelphia.

CRht4ujXUsr95xfGoZVmQw,3,2015-06-07 21:38:02,4,b7TNNG28KBqCrtNr_C0eqQ,"So there's this karaoke rent-a-room and sing with friends type place that's been around forever - everywhere in the world it seems but just recently started up here. Or at least as far as I'm concerned - I'm always late to such parties. There's this place called August Karaoke Box (八月恋歌) in Tempe on the south side of University between McClintock and Rural - more specifically in the mall at University @ Dorsey that has businesses like Republic Ramen. You basically pass Republic Ramen and go south into the parking lot and it's in the same building on the east side of the building. There's also a rock climbing place to the south so it can be busy and the parking situation can vary. 

So... I've been here a few times with friends and there are things I like about it and things that I am not particularly pleased with. I'll break it down for y'all...

Pros:

1) During the weekdays of Monday through Thursday before 8 pm you pay 15 bucks an hour. That works out pretty cheap if you come with friends. It's usually not crowded in the afternoons at all. 

2) You get a private room so nobody sees you singing except for your friends if you're the shy type and are mortified about the idea of singing in front of people. This also allows you to try out songs you normally wouldn't dare without any embarassment when the song becomes a trainwreck. 

3) These rooms allow you to have a private party for as long as you like and are willing to pay for. 

Cons:

1) Catalog - I understand that the reason this KTV place even exists is the Chinese speaking clientele - which is why I wasn't too surprised when the receipt I got after paying was almost all in Chinese characters. That said they could use a much bigger English language artist catalog. It's funny that the Rod Stewart and Bee Gees song catalogs are much bigger than the Beatles catalog and there isn't any Rolling Stones at all that I could find. Nor could I find any Eagles. Or Led Zeppelin. Been here a few times and I can see the novelty fading pretty quickly after going through all the available songs that I like/know. It might be my lack of Karaoke GUI navigation skills but I searched by artist and looked at all the offerings for each particular artist. What's weird is you can type in songs by name and they sometimes come up even if the artist isn't listed in the artists section. Oh well. 

2) The way the lyrics show up on the screen are usually two lines at a time. During faster paced songs the transitioning of the lyrics to the next pair of lyrics can sometimes be slow enough that you can be caught waiting/wondering what the rest of the lyrics are (if you don't know the song too well). Most karaoke bar type setups have a full screen of lyrics at a time to avoid that. 

3) The backing tracks/video. So some of the songs have the actual music video or live video of the artists playing their songs. Some of them have some weird Chinese videos of women walking through the street but having nothing to do at all with the song itself. Awkward. But some of the audio tracks sound like MIDI - like you're listening to an old school arcade game rendition of that song. Fortunately not all songs are like that.

If you're a karaoke fan this might appeal to you to try at least once anyway. As always, your mileage may vary.",7,0d7gFJUi4cV3I7j1dHn9fQ

The selections are great. I love the different wine flight options they have. I have only had a few things on the menu, but the bruchetta was amazing! They have updated the seating area and added a patio. The live music is always awesome, and really helps create a relaxing environment. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable. 

A few people mentioned high prices,  but I think it's on par with all the other wine bars I have visited. Plus, the food is better than most and the service is great. Love it!",3,wltqKnePHZrpDtrAw-eKBg

The dessert section has all kinds of sweet delicacies, and the drink possibilities are numerous. There are some times where one menu runs out, but it is quickly refilled.

First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour. 

However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment. 

Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing ""happy"" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray. We tried to send them back once, only to receive the same soggy sad excuse for a fry back in return. Steer clear. I've had a few items that were decent from the menu, the seared tuna and the patty melt were both nice but IMO, this place is just not worth the inconsistent service, food, and pricing.",2,no2kFt4TEEzZDVaM8haSDA

He was looking forward to seeing Panda! for weeks, and it met our expectations by creating a family-friendly evening.

When he woke up this morning, he immediately commented on last night's show by saying he wanted to help the Panda save the Peacock Princess from the bad guy.  This suggests he had been remembering the show all night.

I recommend buying the cheapest tickets you can find, anywhere from free to $50.  I wouldn't splurge for the $100 seats, as this is a show that even the higher balcony seats can enjoy.

My favorite act was the juggler.  He juggled and bounced up to 10 ping pong balls without skipping a beat, even while walking up and down stairs -- very impressive!

I like how the monkeys get the audience involved by throwing large panda beach balls into the crowd.  And the life-size pandas available to interact with and take pictures with the kids are a great touch.

They were well staffed, and not too busy maybe 4 other tables in there with us. The restaurant itself is huge! Counting the large outside seating area.
   
      SEATING/AMBIANCE:We were seated right away and noticed immediately the ambiance was incredible! We started by trying a couple of their Mule Cocktails as there was a beverage cart making them table side which was neat. The Mule's were average, nothing spectacular. Then after a time our server greeted us after having had our drink order taken and our cocktails made at the beverage cart and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken entree and the Beef Short Rib Ravioli along with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and a side of Vegetables.  
         THE FOOD was served promptly which is always nice! The presentation of each and every course was immaculate (which it should be for the prices and being a fine dining establishment). The food itself however was underwhelming and we were rather disappointed in the quality of flavor or lack thereof. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was really just Okay along with the almost flavorless Mashed potatoes. The vegetables didn't have much flavor and were somewhat watery. The Buttermilk Chicken was average for fried chicken, probably the best thing was the Beef Short Rib Ravioli which even then I would say was just ""Good"" the best thing about it was it's unique sauce with nice flavor. The portions of course were very small (even for fine dining) and expensive. Need to deliver more then beautiful presentation and ambiance, especially in Vegas were fine restaurants are a dime a dozen.
        THE SERVICE: We maybe saw our server twice and only for a moment each time once to take order and again to deliver bill all other contact was with the the Food Delivery person or Beverage cart attendant.

I was in town for a conference, so this hotel was perfect for meeting up with colleagues and for the ease of going to the meetings and then back to my room to rest up. I highly recommend Westgate if you're not needing to be in the middle of the Strip (not walking distance), and if you're at the Conference Center for business. I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more ""themed"" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino.

I had broke a nail heading to Pittsburgh because of my bags. I thought I would just stop by the nearest nailshop where I was staying. I didn't mind the previous reviews because people are dramatic. I know a good nailshop when I see one because my mom use to own one. 

I walked in and was greeted by a short girl. I just told her I want a manicure cause of my one finger. They immediately sat me down and started working on me. My manicurist was so funny, she is definitely a people's person. Come to find out that she was the owner! Thanks Michelle! She looks young, but don't let that fool you. She knows what she's doing. 

I decided to get a pedicure as well. Might as well right? I'm on vacation and especially since I'm already having a great time getting a manicure. Thanks Tran for offering me a cup of wine. I had two. I couldn't help myself. I was surprised they didn't charge me. Turns out it's complimentary! You can't tell me that hasn't gotten you sold on coming here? 

I got a deluxe pedicure, and I almost fell asleep until Michelle decided to scrub my feet. I was about to kick her in the face. I'm ticklish haha Michelle added some aroma therapeutic salt into the water which made my legs and feet so smooth. She does a great job massaging and moisturizing your legs. 

I even snap chatted her joking around. She's funny. I uploaded her pic via snapchat! Check the pictures!

Impeccable service. Thanks y'all.

They were all so nice and orderly, I have never experienced that at a music venue. The one 'bad' thing I'd say is the woman who was running the seating on the mezzanine takes her job WAY too seriously and could not be bothered about anything, even when we had questions, but that one negative isn't deterring me from still leaving a 5 star review for everything else.

I didn't watch the Cake Boss show but I knew about it and wanted to try the restaurant.  We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.

We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.

For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.

I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.

For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.

Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.

December 2015 we were looking for a tree service to get an out of control tree in our front yard under control, and saw a Hayward team working on trees in the neighborhood, check them out on Yelp, and had them out to for an estimate, it was suggested that the tree should be thinned out, and balanced, partly because we had been hacking away at the tree over the years trying to keep it off the house. Service was completed and we were impressed with all aspects of the service.
Well here we are at the end of 2016 and thinking we should work more on thinning and shaping the tree in the front, and to our surprise we got a call from Hayward on Wednesday, they came out on Thursday for an estimate since we wanted three trees in the back yard worked on, and a Queen Palm removed.

Almost as soon as we sat, the manager came over and introduced himself and gave us some of the story of the restaurant and the Head Chef. (Who recently beat Bobby Flay!). The manager truly seemed excited to tell us about it...he was a young guy, so it was cool to see him so animated!  When our waiter arrived, he was just excited as the manager to work with us and explain the different cuts of meat and preparation, etc. He was able to knowledgeably recommend wines to us.

I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.

There was no reason for the undeniably slow service as there was 2 waiters and a busser serving 3 small parties and 1 large party. The waiters were nice but you can tell they did not know what they were doing as they were serving out incorrect orders and sent one of our items to a neighboring table. I had the char su ramen with thick noodles and my fiancée had char su ramen with thin noodles. They did not refill our drinks and we had to ask numerous times only to be forgotten again. The menu selection is not extensive and if you cannot tell the difference between thick noodles and thin noodles then you probably should not be working there as my waiter had no idea ! It is not the kitchen's job to check to make sure the food is ok, it is the waiters job. The only good thing there was the takoyaki but the chicken karaage was way over cooked and not tasty at all :/",0,rExD8M5ivyNGWUMRjDnPMw

Service was great, and the space was nice-which are soba bun's only saving grace, everything else fell flat. Perhaps our standards are higher given the countless thai restaurants we were fortunate enough to be surrounded by... but even the worse thai spot we'd been to in cali was better than this. The food wasn't bad, it just wasnt very good. 

Like many, we use pad thai as the standard in determining if a thai spot is worth a second try, even if everything else ordered may be less than stellar...if the pad thai is solid then--well done, we'll most likely give it a second go if in the area..but even that wasnt up to par to the worst in cali. The noodles were wrong, didnt have that stickyness one often associate with pad thai and flavor was so-so, not bad but not good... So disappointed, had high hopes and was let down. We also ordered the papaya salad combo  with chicken and sticky rice which  we were super excited about, not many have such a combo, even in cali...but the sticky rice was NOT sticky, papaya salad was so sad. Totally lack luster, no flavor-not even mild (which is usually our complaint-love that burn your tongue spice) it was just bland. The chicken...wow, the chicken, dry and flavorless, didnt even come with peanut sauce or any for that matter. 

Then, there was the thai tea...free with a check in--and even still...never again--watered down, and just sweetened to mask the lack of tea...why?!?!...ah such a sad day for thai food...",0,Q29UE2TUX5P2_gohwszvUg

They texted me that they would get back to me later, then eventually sent a quote via text (all of my interactions have been via text. Um... okay). After a few days, I told them I would like to proceed and would they please come over and look at my windows. They said they would be able to come the following week. 

They never came nor did they tell me why they never got back to me. So I texted them today asking if they were ever coming or if I should look elsewhere. They texted me back seven hours later that they now have a big job in Casa Grande that will take a month. Thanks. Buh-bye.

We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable. 

The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area). 

Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on. 

To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me. 

Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.

Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.

Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)

Nice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that's to be expected.

The mac & cheese was excellent. I'm not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that's also to be expected.

Cafe Sanuki more closely mirrors the style of restaurant in Japan where you aren't sitting down for an hour to grab a meal that takes moments to prepare and execute and requires almost no service beyond getting your food.

Walking in, you are greeted by the open style kitchen, a display of their dishes, as well as someone making and cooking udon noodles. You walk up with a tray and order, receive your udon unless it is one that takes longer to prepare, grab tempura with plastic tongs, and choose side dishes if you like. Then you pay for your food. 

Then you grab any of the open tables and enjoy your food. When done, you simply leave your tray in a bussing area (not sure if we are supposed to clear our tray but employees seem to be cleaning up the area).

Quick, convenient, great value. And the udon is quite tasty too. I have had a chance to sample the niku, onsen tamago and the mentaiko cream udon. The beef was very tasty and tender. The tamago is imported from Japan and is organic and vegetarian, and the mentaiko cream had great flavor.

I had a chance to try the miso pork belly rice bowl as well - the pork belly was okay, but I'd definitely focus on the udon here. 

A special note about their lemonade - it's a little creamy and light in flavor which is actually pleasant because it is not overwhelmingly sweet.

One thing to watch out for might be noodle texture. The first time we went our noodles were a little overcooked and too soft. They were intensely busy with a line out the door and it was soft opening so I won't hold it against them, as the second time was better.",3,KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ

Meeting up with a friend for lunch today, he was raving about their Lazeez on the rocks which essentially is chicken shawarma on lentil rice doused on garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce. As I was lining up to order I saw them slathering on the sauce and immediately reconsidered my options thinking that I could find a healthier option.

After some tough decision making I went with the mixed grill which was about $14 plus tax. They warned me that because it's cooked to order and not simply carved off the spit that it would take about 10-15 minutes to prepare. in addition to 3 different meats (shawarma, a kebab and a kafta) the dish came with either fries or potatoes, a choice of 2-3 salads and either lentil rice or regular rice. That's a lot of food!

I went with lentil rice, fatoush salad (my favourite) and potatoes to go along with my meat trio. As promised the majority of my meal took some time but they gave me my fatoush salad right away so I would have something to nosh on while my friend ate his lunch.

Once I had everything I was actually more than a little shocked with how much food there as, nearly two containers worth of food if you include the full sized salad. The rice and potatoes were really good as was the salad but the real star was the meat selection. The shawarma and kebab were very tender, but everything was slathered in sauces so it was hard to judge the taste. The one thing that absolutely floored me was the kofta... WAW!

Imagine if an oval shaped hamburger and a steak had a baby and was cooked to medium rare? Yea that's what I ate... wow. Wow.

I came here with a tutoring student a year or so ago and she knew Wendy from another establishment, and I've been going back whenever I can since. I live a bit far from the location but if I can put up with the drive it can't be beat. Everything I've had here has been excellent! The only complaint I've had was actually from my aunt, who just can't seem to find Singapore Noodles to her liking here in Las Vegas. My favorite dish to get is the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce but I've also gotten to a point where I won't eat chow mein from any other restaurant because I like how Wendy's Noodle Cafe does it the best.

Also, this might sound funny since Wendy's is primarily Chinese/Cantonese cuisine, but I hadn't found an appreciation for kimchi until I had it here with their grilled beef short ribs.

Customer service here is great, especially considering how busy it can get in the evenings. Everyone is friendly from the owner to the staff and they're really sweet about putting up with me since I drink water by the gallon whenever I eat, so kudos for that. I always get a funny look when I order dishes without bean sprouts (I've had traumatic experiences with them, I'm sorry!) There are always complimentary peanuts (that I swear taste better than any peanuts I've ever bought? Where do I get these peanuts??) and people checking in on you, even when the restaurant is a bit busier. The place is clean and has a great atmosphere, and there's a TV typically playing music shows from China/Hong Kong or Korean music videos that are quiet enough to complement rather than interrupt your meal.

I highly recommend the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce - and ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're a fan of the taste like I am. The Korean-inspired BBQ short ribs are a good deal for their price and I honestly order all the more customizable dishes here (like noodles and rice) with chicken because it's perfectly juicy and tender and I've never encountered so much as a bite of gristle. The complaints about things being under-seasoned in other reviews are valid--I've had my share of more mild dishes here than I'm used to, but considering I can just ask for more sauce on the dish I'm obsessed with, it's never bothered me. Plus, I've got heart problems, so the less salt the better!",0,7WgmtfyZ4eBKNFJ2T5w4YQ

It's been roughly 2-3 years since I have been to lidias, an experience in which I remember having decent food and service... Tonight was far different.

Overall, let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated. Colors and decor seem boring and out of style. I didn't get that warm feeling I should in a place where there are white clothes, $12 average glasses of wine (like come on - I looked up the crappy bottle it came from) and waiters everywhere.

The service was horrible. From hostess crew to the bar to the waitress, it was bad. The hostess forgot about us, then when I reminded him we were waiting (40 minutes - despite a reservation), to which he said ""oh yes, I was just going to get you""... But he wasn't because we stood there a few minutes while he set the table. Rude.

Did I mention the service was bad? Well, while we were waiting we had a glass of wine each (a steep $13.50 glass each - definitely didn't live up to my expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned with us and weren't friendly at all. They were chatting to themselves and basically ignoring us.  When we got to the table, it took 10 mins to meet our waitress. Then it took another 15 to order.  Then 50 mins to get our food!!! I had the pasta trio (remember this meal takes no time to cook  - as this is ready made and constantly being served) and my wife had the porkchop. Honestly, we typically enjoy our restaurant food (just read my Casbah review) but our food was really just so-so. My wife's pork chop was fatty and over-cooked (despite the waitress specifically making note of how the chef prefers to cook it medium). My pasta was decent, which I ate, and requested seconds (which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know until I told her politely. Then she blamed new staff working the pasta routes... No good enough reason for me - sorry. 

Then the bill.  I ordered the pasta trio for $23 and the waitress asked me if I wanted to upgrade my Salad for $2, to which I approved. However she charged the $36 pasta trio (which comes with desert). I told her this was a mistake and she agreed and ran back with a new check. Now I had a $10 salad and $23 pasta trio. I was expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained to her politely that I ordered the $23 trio to which she (must have) mistakenly offered me an upgrade. I accepted. However I was told I was wrong and she didn't offer to make this right. Ugh. Seriously you want to fight me on it? Especially when I know I was being appropriately (not like I was trying to score a free meal). Isn't the rule ""customer is always right""?

Finally, we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined. How many people did we see in tie-dye shirt or wearing hats (literally wearing hats at 8:30pm in a fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough to know that this isn't the lidias we expected.

We won't ever go back or recommend the place.  As far as we are concerned - there is a very good reason that you don't have a problem getting a reservation here (because IT STINKS!).

The reason being is that my husband and I ate there over the weekend and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. On the menu it said it had fresh carrots, celery, and onions on it. Sounded fab! But when it can out it was a greasy mess of a pizza. It looked like they threw some chicken and wing sauce on a regular cheese pizza and called it a day. And since the base of most wing sauces is butter it mad the pizza go greasy we could barely eat it. 

With that being said, we have eaten hear several other times and always loved it! The antipasto salad is amazing. and the Greek pizza is yummo. Their wings are some of the best I've had, and I don't say that lightly. I LOVE hot wings and am pretty picky about them. Red devil makes them super crispy with lots of sauce.

She found out we didn't like it and ended up taking it off our bill. I guess it pays to be honest in a semi-high end restaurant.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I really wanted to try Houstons. The prime rib we ordered was alright, and I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was TO DIE FOR! The marinade on it was perfect but the only thing was that it somewhat charred the meat since I'm guessing there was sugar in the marainade and that burns quickly. Our dishes came with a HUGE baked potato that I couldn't even finish.

Overall, I would revisit Houstons again for their Hawaiian Rib Eye and perhaps some sushi rolls.",3,vsfG95vDU20d7upU1Zs6uA

This brewery is tucked away in the distillery district and comes with a full fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. And guess what street it's on? 

Mill Street is basically known for it's ""big 4"" beers; the ones sold in the LCBO. These consist of the tankhouse ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. However, if you go into the actual bar you'll be greeted by a slew of new and seasonal beers that they only have there. These range from your fruit beers to your stouts to your bocks and Oktoberfests. The variety is mezmerizing and delightful. Be sure to wet your whistle with a sample if your not feeling too adventurous. I know I wasn't trying the imperial chocolate stout.  Can't decide?  Try a taster pack. It's basically a couple of the beers in little cups so you can try them all.  

I won't go into all the different beers they have because honestly they may not be there the next time I'm back. I'll list my top 3. 

First we have the cobblestone stout. I've been around the city trying differen stouts and comparing but coming from drinking guinness all the time nothing really pairs up. The cobblestone stout does though. The beer is nitrogen infused so unless guinness wants to release their nitrogen widget patent you won't be seeing thus out of the bar anytime soon. Upon pourig the stout expect the magical cascading that you usually expect to wait for. The head on the stout afterwards isn't as thick as the guinness head, more like the head on a boddington's. The stout tastes rich with hints of walnuts and chocolate. Definitely my favourite. 

Next we have the stock ale. This beer is a lighter beer similar to a sleemens cream ale (kinda). The stock ale is refreshing and crisp with a nice balanced finish. This one's actually sold in the beer store so be sure to try it out. I actually just picked up two kegs for a party. Yes, we really like it. 

Narrowing it down to another is kinda hard but i'd have to go with the belgian wit. I'm also a fan of wit beers (wit, wheat, white). The wit is characterized with aromas of corriander and oranges, quite nice on a summer day. I actually was hooked on the wit at luminato one year (mill st is known for sponsoring a slew of events in toronto). The beer is served with a slice of orange to accentuate the flavours in the beer and in my opinion is the best part. After throwing the orange in to soak everthing up it turns into this kinder surprise magical treat at the end of your beer.  This beer is also sold in the beer stores and LCBO. I'd try and pour it out to drink it though cause it's fermented in the bottle and you want to give the bottom a whirl before drinking it. 

The bar/restaurant is actually very nice. Large and expansive with a view of the distilling tins. I've been to a bunch of gatherings here and with a call ahead it's great for large parties. 

I can't say very much about the food.  I didn't have it this time and don't remember it from the last time
I was here. Maybe another day.

PS  Their imperial chocolate stout has chocolate from soma chocolates across the street in it. Delicious.  Heading there now.",2,-hUgrj7Lzir3yLUYrMYQ4g

It was really busy during Sunday brunch time, the slender bar/restaurant area was packed and I noticed a few customers leave after seeing how packed it was. Our large group reserved the banquet room which is surrounded by racks upon racks of wine and is centered around a unique copper-like dining table. 

I ordered one of the enchilada dishes, and asked to have one of them with their red chile and the other with green chile sauce. If you get the enchiladas, I only suggest the green chile, though. Atop them laid an over-easy egg, also served with pinto beans and a cubed potatoe mixture that was quite tasty. This dish was amazing! One of their most popular brunch dishes is the Carne Adovada Burrito, which I constantly hear rave reviews on (come on an empty stomach- its BIG!).

Their new office is beautiful and they seem to be settling in well. They could use a little more warmth (rug? color? lower lighting? fish tank?) in the new waiting room. Right now there are just chairs lined up on four white walls, a magazine rack, and a TV high up on one of the walls. A couple of big planters outside the front door would be more welcoming too.

Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.

Great choice, there is no comparison between video and live with this show.  And in addition I got my answer.  They do not own the audience but set up and atmosphere where the audience  wants to ""play"" with them and everyone else in the theater and just have fun; a kind of communal contact high.  Good band, funny, integrated routines and a good multimedia light/prop show.

Tried to get ahold of her to figure out how we could fix it only to be ignored for 3 days and when I finally went in, she was rolling her eyes and looking at the other barbers to show how ""mistreated"" she was.

They have a ton of space here with a lot of it just sitting empty. The staff is useless. Do not go on a weekend. The place is teaming with kids and there is hardly anything to play on so they are all crowded on the slide. The age cut off is 12 so if you have a 3 year old beware, the 12 year olds will literally run your kid over. There is not a single staff member watching over anything, they just sit at the front desk texting on their phones. I actually read the care instructions on the slide itself written by the slide manufacturer and it says the slide must be under ""professional supervision at all times."" That is not the case and apparently there were no parents of the older kids around so they just dominated the slide pushing down the smaller kids and climbing up the slide instead of the stairs.

The service was alright - we did walk in after all. I took a moment to peruse the tattoo books, and I what I saw was so-so to decent. If I got a tattoo, it would not be from here. After about twenty minutes, the woman at the front asked us what we wanted. We were instructed to pick from the jewelry, which was fine with me. My friend had brought his own in, but they refused to pierce him with it for health reasons. So the actual cost was that of the piercing plus that of the jewelry. It ended up being moderately pricey, and they only accepted cash, which was very annoying.

Finally we were taken to the back. I sat in a chair while the piercer  consulted me on the locations of my piercings and began sanitizing the area. She also had what seemed to be a piercing license, which was good. She used a sterile needle straight from the package. It hurt sooo bad. Once we were done, she strictly instructed me on the care of my piercings, and told me what sort of items to treat it with. All told, it took about twenty minutes from the start of the process to the finish.

We ordered a slice of tiramisu for the heck of it; it came with a whipped cream pouf and a coffee bean on top. The next day I was at Costco with my wife and she was looking at the cakes and guess what was there? The exact same tiramisu cake with the little puff and coffee bean on top. The cake was something like $12 in costco and we paid I think $8 or $10 for a small slice. Kind of put me off from returning to the Beaconsfield to be honest.

I never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.

I got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.

They had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move."" My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone. 

The chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area. 

That was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.

We left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces. 

Basically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos. Not even a freaking glass of water.",4,sYPuLHkyWjOjjNPYgrkt-Q

To me, that is not a big enough discount to warrant buying such boring purses. I guess you can call me cheap but I would rather pay less and have a stylish purse that might fall apart within a year or pay about a hundred dollars more (300.00) and go to a normal coach store and get a purse I love that apparently also is of a better quality. Not only that, this outlet store doesnt have nearly enough employees for the amount of people that visit here. If I had even had a question, there is no way I would have had it answered. It was weird because at the Coach store at Ceasars, the sales girl was a little too attentive and came off as fake. Yet, at the outlet store, the sale people could have cared less and seemed almost rude probably from being overworked and stressed out. Honestly, I was initially excited to visit here but walked out disappointed. This outlet store was not only an unpleasant shopping experience but it also didnt seem like a real great deal price wise to me. Yes, I cringe thinking about spending 300.00 at a real Coach store, however, it seems a little more worth it then still paying alot and buying something that I am really not that happy with at the Outlet all for the sake of having a Coach purse.",0,F10QJk-i3IrUxKcJI9CF-g

First thing I saw was the lovely hostess as soon as I got off the elevator. Cute concept. My reservation not being available til 30 minutes later?, not so cute.

I can't remember how long ago it was that I had to wait that long to be seated when their was actually a reservation in place.

The interior: wasn't impressed.. had a very IKEA feel to it and didn't like our table. The chair looked like folding chairs you would put in your back yard. Ordered a Mimosa and it was in a plastic glass?? Really? Okay...

The food: I ordered a side fries, the avocado toast and a Mimosa. My bill was close to $50 and not worth the quality of food served.

The avocado toast was okay? Lacked flavour. The potato hash accompanied were not fresh but very dried out. The fries tasted like they were frozen or left out too long. How do you screw up fries? Mimosa tasted bitter.

I asked my guests how they liked their dishes and they weren't impressed either. Our server ran hot and cold at times. Their was an older gentleman that finally picked up my plate when I was done and apologized for it sitting there so long. I think he must have been the owner or manager.

The only thing I enjoyed was taken pictures on the rooftop. The reason I gave this place 2 stars was the service, the food and the fact that we weren't seated promptly. I actually thought it was pretty rude that they seemed very nonchalant about it.

Instead of starting over and maybe speaking with me at my appointment about our misunderstanding, this manager ordered her staff to deny me services and tried to force me to take down my review. It is apparent that they didn't take any advise from my post 6 months ago when I suggested a re-training course on customer service. I refused to take down my review because it was my opinion of this facility based on the way I was being treated.

I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.

Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)

First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS. 

Here are some things to remember when waiting here:

-The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar.
-You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them.
- Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too!
-You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed)
-Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them.
-The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed ""gay tacos"". 
-You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it.
-The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring.",3,KP-xppgLaUx1M905B_K7Gw

Unfortunately (like a few other Scottsdale locations) they either over charge (i.e. your credit card receipt says one thing and your card statement says another)  or charge your card multiple times.      

It's Old Town Scottsdale so the 'scene' is typical of many of the bars in the area.  We met up with some friends who had already claimed an outside/patio table for 6, the 2 of us made 8 so we sat at the end of the table.  Service was doing what they could to get through the throngs of people, but we were left thirsty and wondering, more times than not, where was our server .  The saving grace was the company we were with and the DJ was playing some pretty fresh mixes.  [Yeah I am a sucker for a good DJ.]

The food looked good and the menu was unique.  If you are looking for a little fun and a typical days worth of calories, they have these adult shakes mixed with booze, ice cream, favorite kids breakfast cereal favorites and other stuff.

The decor and atmosphere is awesome, upbeat with a lounge feel. They have an outstanding cocktail/martini list. Our waiter arrived promtly to take our cocktail orders and returned shortly thereafter with drinks and a couple plates of complimentary appitizers courtesy of our Hard Rock VIP Casino host. This is a steak place and everyone ordered steaks/fillets. Everything was prepared to everyones liking and we had orders from rare to well at our table and everyone got the prep they requested (impressive). The sides were all delicious as well. Service was above average. My only few small complaints were that the coffee we ordered with our dessserts was cool (barely luke warm) and by the time our waiter came back by to check on us again we were all done with our deserts but he did take the coffee and deserts off our bill. My only other teenie tiny complaint is the menu was lacking much variety in addition to steaks. Don't get me wrong,  I know it's a steak place, but I like to be more adventerous and the non-steak/non-beef entrees that were on the menu looked plain and boring in my opinion.

Get everything ""Extreme Spicy"" for maximum flavour, their is also a chef special spicy which is not written on the menu but they can make it for you.

Reminiscent of Bloor's Toronto Reference Library in design, I'd say NYCL is the cozy younger sibling. Also, unlike the Reference Library, a lot more of the books are actually for circulation. Each floor is divided according to field of interest, with whole stacks devoted solely to business, and another level to science. The very top floor is also worth a gander with its impressive collection of microfilms. If you're looking to study, I can vouch for the pin-drop noise level of the upper floors. Plenty of natural lighting and seating, as well as power outlets. The occasional coat trees dotting the perimeter were well made use of during my February visit. 

Super convenient location for those commuting by TTC as it is in the same complex as North York Center Station. There is also a bustling food court if reading makes you peckish (I know it make me...but then again, I'm always up for a bite) and I believe food is allowed in the library's bottom floor study hall.

This hotel is a 4 star 4 diamond hotel. This was a very nice and clean hotel!  They have security around the elevators.

The sauce is usually vinegar based with some added spices especially red peppers. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled. 

The other mostly in western NC is usually pork shoulders either slow cooked over wood or gas. Gas is becoming a popular fuel to conserve wood and the air quality. The wood adds some great flavor and many people don't want it any other way. Pork shoulders are smaller cuts of meat and cook in less time. The cooked meat usually is served with a mayonnaise based slaw, fries or on a sandwich. If you order a basket or tray you usually just get BBQ and hush puppies. If you order a plate you get fries and probably a side of slaw. The sides can certainly vary... so ask. The sauce is usually thick and red, based with ketchup some added spices especially red peppers and vinegar. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled.
 
Many area restaurants now offer BBQ Chicken and beef brisket (mostly a Texas dish) along with pork spare ribs and beef ribs too. These items are not typically found with true NC family BBQ establishments... mostly the larger ones trying the satisfy more people with their offerings. 

Since Concord and Charlotte are in the middle of the state... you will find both types here.",2,b_3AWll3wtidFQO76om8YQ

For dinner at the downtown location I ordered the bruschetta to start things off and split the Sunday Lunch for Two which consisted of meatballs, sausages, and beef ribs laying on top of a bed of pasta with tomato sauce and cheese. Bruschetta was good, and that sausage was great! Of course to wash it all down I took the classic Gentile iced tea.

Another Resturant that I've been visiting for about 10 years. I'm going keep this short and sweet.

Let's start with the good:
Great place for eating ANYTIME of the day as it's 24/7.
The cashier there is very friendly and funny.
Food quality is good and the portion is decent.
T-Bones has always been good with consistency.
Steaks are great. I cannot speak about the burgers because I always get a steak there.

Now, onto the bad.
Not so much bad but here goes:

only had one bad experience with steak there. I ordered a rare steak and I couldn't eat it. I don't know if it's the type of steak but it was gross. So I only eat medium rare there..other places like keg or red lobster I'll take a rare steak. 

Price increase of the steak special from 11.99 to 16 or 17.99! Really??? One special will not fill me up so I don't go there as much as I use to because of the price increase.

T bones is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fries or mashed potato. 

3/5 due to the price increase

Here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo

It also states on their website that they offer beer, champagne, wine, water and coffee while you get your nails done. The website also states they do hot stone massage. When I got to the salon, I was assigned to Freda and she was nice but didn't say anything throughout the pedicure. I was never offered any drinks, instead I had to ask for a water. She was working very quickly and I think she took a total of 20 minutes on my pedi. There was also no hot stones used.
The icing on the cake was that there is a 75 cent fee charged when you make your appt online which requires your credit card information and it shows you owe the remaining amount at the salon. When I was paying, they charged me the full amount- I mentioned the website fee and the lady said she didn't know anything about it and that fee doesn't go to the salon. I mentioned they should fix that then as it is misleading. She blamed the owners and said ""I hear you"" but she didn't fix the transaction.

Every month I have to call in an order for my infant son's formula. Every month I have to fight with them in order to get the order shipped to me. The first thing I'm told is they denied the order because they don't have the medical necessity on file yet after fighting with them they review the file and find out. Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?  No phone call no email nothing to inform me of the issue. I call on the 1st it's another 2 hour phone call of they need this info they need that it's being held up my coding now it's being held up by billing. Finally the issue is resolved they are sending out formula I recieve an email and surprise I'm only getting half my order. Why?  Today is another merry go round I've talked to probably 10+ reps nobody has an answer and the issue still isn't resolved. Save yourself the stress and go with a different company. Edgepark doesn't care about their customers who depend on them to provide services that they bill insurance for. They show no compassion and no initiative to resolve issues as they arise.

Lunch specials for about $5.65 and dinner specials for about $8 and up.  The dinner combo includes soup, egg roll, two fried shrimp, veggie fried rice and the entree of your choice.  I prefer less food but have tastier food.  Too much of bad is just bad, but a little bit of good is excellent.  
Here's why my star allocation is the way it is:
1.  Egg drop soup which comes with the Dinner combination had very little taste.  It is about 4 ounces but considering it is free, some consumers would appreciate it.  I would rather have no soup than tasteless soup.
2.  The free fried shrimp which come with the dinner combo were 70% crust.  Shrimp not cleaned. Found a long string of poop when I opened it.  A bit oily too.  See photos.  
3.  My House chow mein which came with Fried rice did not have much flavor. A few drops of sesame oil would have done the trick.  I added soy sauce to make it taste better.  If you see the photo, it looks delightful but it is a disappointment to the taste.
4.  Hubby LOVED his Orange chicken.  It was thinly sliced chicken and lightly crusted.  They should have followed suit on the shrimp and they would have been perfect.  Had brown rice with it for 50 cents extra.  
5.  Egg roll was pretty good.  Lots of veggies and not too greasy until you get to the end of the egg roll but that is to be expected.
Cordial service, clean place, very fair pricing.

And last night when I was making a last minute run for a travel water dish, WNW filled the void perfectly (even though it was 7:58 p.m. and they close at 8 p.m., the staff was super friendly--I couldn't say I'd have the same enthusiasm if I was in that situation). Today cemented my faith in WNW: the ice cream social was crazy awesome. 

As some may know, we had an addition to our family recently. Max is a 3 year old cocker spaniel who was approaching being placed in a shelter [one of my coworker's customers alerted her to his family's predicament and she came to me to intervene. Although Robert was scheduled to leave town for a week, we decided to give Max a chance that Friday night and he's blended perfectly into our home. Brady now has a new brother and I'm happy to report that they have grown rather attached.] Needless to say, we're still on the learning curve when it comes to Max's temperament, which was rather challenged in the presence of so many dogs Saturday. But, true to form, the staff remained encouraging (unlike some of the queenie bitches who weren't on leashes) and gave us hope that Max, like Brady, will be able to mellow out. 

Both of our kids had lovely, customized baths (Brady went for sleek and shiny while Max opted for citrus wash) which we were able to administer at our leisure. A bucket of washing goodies was brought out--brushes, shampoo, cream rinse, leave-in conditioner, towels and a wash cloth. The attendants were there to answer any questions along the way. The drying stations are separate from the washing basins, which was different from SD, but makes sense since now. 

While I agree some of the prices are on the high end, I'd much rather invest my money with a smaller business then dump my paycheck into Wal-Mart. If you're looking for Wal-Mart prices, you should expect Wal-Mart customer service. WNW is leaps and bounds above and beyond its competitors.",10,pKn_H1nkgrwJS6TuHODsvQ

So I found the exact same sectional, that was used, but still in great shape. The cushions, however, were just sad and beat up and ugly. I spent too many hours online researching about upholstery and now I know A LOT about fabrics and foam. haha. I'd never upholstered anything in my life. At first I was going to buy new fabric cushions online, but that would still take 3-4 weeks and I was running out of time. Plus I didn't trust fabric I couldn't touch/see in person, nor was I comfortable with my measuring skillz. The sectional is huge and from my research I knew it'd be pricey. I went on yelp. I found one place, but the fabric was just OK, not what I wanted, and the guy was kinda rude. Another place I went to, the price was eye-popping. o.O I was ready to give up.

I found Oscar's Upholstery on here, which had fewer reviews than the rest, but were all 5 star. I was frustrated with the whole process by then, but wanted to get out of the office. Since his locale is close to my work I went up to see what he could offer.
 
First off, he greeted me with a smile and shook my hand even as I waltzed in telling him what I needed without taking a breath. Immediately, to my shock, he had the exact fabric I was looking for. Then I held my breath for the price. My day got better! It was more than reasonable and way more my price range!!! He had it done in a week (all 8 of the back cushions and the HUGE 4 seat cushions). He also had me bring in my old cushions so he could stuff them for me. :D I can't express how relieved I am to have found Oscar. He did amazing work so fast and I'm ecstatic with the results!! I now have a go-to upholstery guy and will tell all my friends about him. He's personable, professional, and a man of his craft! Truly a 5 star find. See my before & after pics.

My only minor gripe about them is when you order something that includes a salad and you agree to have what they refer to as ""everything"" on the salad, they only put a few things on. I feel it a bit much to specify each topping when I literally do want everything they have on my salad :-/

The Belgian Waffle and BBQ Pork Ribs was the dish of choice.  Waffles and Ribs for Breakfast?  We were in heaven!  I've told others of this combo and even showed them our photos.  They were disgusted and said that was the most unhealthy breakfast they'd ever heard of.  How can 4 smoked baby back ribs be worse for you than say 4 link sausages or 4 slices of bacon, both of which are fried?  Although the meat didn't fall off the bone, the ribs were tender.  I wasn't fond of the sauce, it was a little too tangy for my taste. (see photo)

The fresh apple mini fritters were also a hit.  They're fried fresh to order, served hot, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  (see photo)

We also had the chicken and mushroom scramble.  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onion, fontina + cream cheese.  It was good, but definately not my favorite of the three, and I probably wouldn't order it again.

It's not a big deal but the girl on the phone wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Despite having bad service on the phone, we came anyway to try out luck and waited for over 45 minutes. When we were finally seated, the servers rushed us to order the food. We barely had time to crack open the menu before we were asked to order. 

The quality of the food was fairly good. The sauces came out quickly except for soy sauce. We had asked them to get us soy sauce 4 times but they always forgot to bring it. Finally, we had to just order soy sauce with no menu items to make sure we could get that sauce. 

At the end of the meal, we got ice cream! Each person at the table is able to have 1 soft serve each. :) The ice cream at the end was definitely the highlight of my meal.

The Australian Bee Gees show is a celebration of one of disco's most legendary names, bringing the music that shaped the cultural landscape of the 1970's to the Excalibur Hotel & Casino.  I am nothing if not a Bee Gees fan (my wedding processional was ""More Than a Woman"" and my recessional was ""How Deep Is Your Love""), so the opportunity to see their pre-eminent tribute group was one that I relished.

The Australian Bee Gees did not disappoint, suspending the belief of the audience for 75 minutes with Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb.  They opened with favorites ""You Should Be Dancing"" and ""Jive Talkin'"".  In their addresses to the audience, they capture the essence of the Brothers Gibb, quirks, flowing locks, and all.

ABG was inclusive in their tribute, covering everything from the soulful, early hits like ""Massachusetts,"" ""I've Got to Get a Message to You,"" and ""I Started a Joke,"" to their Saturday Night Fever and disco hits like ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""Tragedy,"" and ""If I Can't Have You (I Don't Want Nobody, Baby).""  They even performed the title track to Grease, which, though performed by Frankie Valli for the film and soundtrack, was written by Barry Gibb, a fact often overlooked by even the most devoted of Bee Gees fans.

Anyone who loves the Bee Gees will undoubtedly be pleased by both the song selections and the interactive nature of the show.  ABG not only performed everyone's favorites, devoting time to more than just their number one hits, they also gave the audience the opportunity to show off their disco moves at ""Mo's,"" an area of the theatre designated as Maurice's ""nightclub,"" where the audience could become more than passive spectators and dance to the songs that were meant to be danced to, not just listened to.

The Australian Bee Gees are the closest thing that many of their younger fans will ever get to seeing the Bee Gees perform together and the closest thing that their older fans will have to reliving their favorite concert memories.  Michael Clift, Wayne Hosking, and Dave Scott amply live up to the great responsibility that this fact has placed on them, offering a solid performance that would make Barry, Robin, and Maurice proud.",15,5N5JRCcF9K7L827p9bb28Q

Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.

I originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!

I was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.

Moreover, this place is especially wonderful because it's got a spectacular view. I always love watching the sunset here!

Parking has never personally been an issue for me, but the immediate surrounding parking lot is pretty small. However, there is a ton of parking for all of the other buildings nearby -- which, yes, might be a little dreadful in the Phoenix heat, but honestly, it's totally worth it.

If I'm not at home, the gym or Sprouts, 9 times out of 10, I'm most likely here.",8,Q8zOUnrRqMzkC3H8MN-niA

Pros:
Location 
Price
Cleanliness 
Hospitality 
Room amenities 
Shower! 
Good for families 
Print boarding passes 
WiFi works!! 

Cons:
Motel style, not fancy
Other clientele can be iffy
TV channels are weird 
Plane take off path, but not that bad

My toddler daughter and I stayed for 3 nights. Check in was very pleasant, easy, and informative. They let us check in a little early because the room was ready. The other associate at the desk remembered my name and reassured me that my special request of a downstairs room had been filled. We got a map with our keys, and a reminder about when and where breakfast would be. 

Parking was easy for us. Not every room has a spot in front of it, but there is plenty of parking in my opinion. 

I stayed in room 409. The room was as clean as room of this motel style can be in a location like this. If you've stayed near the Strip in a chain motel then you'll understand what I mean. It was very clean considering how inconsiderate other guests can be. Nothing gross or unidentifiable, no weird stains, no weird smells. Not a hint of cigarette smoke. 

The bath was very clean. The shower has a curved bar and magnets in the bottom so it actually keeps water in. THE SHOWER ACTUALLY HAD PRESSURE AND HOT WATER AND DIDN'T JUST SHOOT OUT MIST. It was glorious. I actually got to rinse the conditioner out of my hair! All the fixtures worked, nothing was broken. There is a vanity area with a separate seat, lots of closet space, and good lighting. 

The kitchenette was not needed, but it had a 2 burner electric stove, a sink, and a ton of cabinet space. The microwave worked very well and was clean, and the mini fridge was as good as you find at most motels. It was clean with no weird smells. 

The AC was great. There's a guard on it to keep your curtains from flying up so people can't see in. It worked very well and wasn't too loud at all.

There's plenty of lighting and electrical outlets for charging phones etc. 

The beds are ok, but some people may not like them. I didn't hate them, but they are a little.... Spring-filled, haha. They never squeaked but they felt like they should. Regardless, we slept just fine on them and didn't have any problems. Bedding was clean, no sign of bugs anywhere (I always check), and the pillows were very nice. 

The TV is a little annoying because it has a lot of empty HD channels that just take up space and make it take forever to channel surf. I only mention this because kids can be super impatient... And some adults to, tbh. Otherwise lots of good channels and a decent sized TV. 

It was really quiet concerning other guests, except one family upstairs was having a door slamming competition, I think. But I couldn't hear anything from the other rooms like TV or talking, so that's all I care about. 

I know some people complained about the airplanes taking off, but that's really hit or miss depending on your room location and the time of day or night. I have lived by lots of airports and train tracks so they don't bother me. My 2 and a half year old slept through all the planes. Every one of them. So it really depends on your tolerance for noises. It can be loud, so use your bet judgement. 

There were some ""not sketchy but still smelled like weed"" types in the parking lot just going about their business, but that's sort of expected in Vegas and in this area, so that's not the motel's fault. And you gotta remember that this is Paradise, so you might have folks coming in from the street soliciting. Just say ""Sorry, man,"" and keep walking, and you should be fine. 

10/10 for me. Very good stay, and I would definitely stay again.",3,1Z7-2FZcW6wgxqxixtFLMQ

However I was gravely mistaken. As I proceeded to order, they told me they were out of most items. Which was a huge disappointment to begin with. I ordered 3 pieces of chicken and two empanadas. As I bit in to the first empanada I realized the dough was raw, the inside was dry, and when I say dry I mean Sahara desert dry, this thing might as well have been named the ""dust bowl"" of the thirties. The crutch for this was the sauce, which was so sparse it might have well cost more than platinum, probably 5 drops at best in the tiny little cup they gave me.

I waited for the main course, 3 pieces of chicken. Everything looked alright, the first bite, very hot tender, but also under cooked. The batter had no seasoning, was basically just flower.... Huge disappointment. A 3 year old child could have made this for 50 cents. If this meal was 4$ I would have gladly taken the diarrhea I had afterwords and possibly come back for more, but only after a depressing day of beating myself up. However at a whopping 20+ dollars I think  I would need to have the worst day of my life and wanted to empty out all my accounts to come here. There are honestly way more choices for much less.

In my opinion, if you grew up in an Asian family and hear the word disappointment on the regular, this is the place to take your parents, maybe they will see you in a higher light by comparison. Or recommend this place to someone you really dislike but they don't realize it yet. Either way dollar for dollar I would go somewhere else, actually even if this place was free I would have to seriously consider somewhere else.",0,BnkzZNWq7neBR3R10CoUow

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",0,YnMHlGm6XX1MtnKqiSgDIA

We ordered 5 meats and 4 sides so that we could have many choices to decide upon our favorites.  First off, the turkey was almost inedible.  The odd seasoning didn't allow me to even finish one slice.  The brisket had almost no flavor and was full of fat and the same goes for rib tips.  The larger ribs lacked flavor. The pork had the most flavor of all the meat we tried but, again, it was fatty.  I don't know what their cooking methods are but I would guess that they boil the meat before smoking it.  When meat is smoked for a long time, flavor develops and the fat melts away during the slow cooking process.  There was way too much fat in the meat and the lack of flavor makes me believe that they are boiling it.  Good barbecue is flavorful and delicious. This was not.  Our sides were collard greens which were okay, mac and cheese, again, just okay, house slaw, okay, and corn bread which was delicious.  Yes, delicious!. 

The decor is really appealing and creatively done.  

We didn't complain about the food because we realize that they obviously think it's great or they wouldn't have the restaurant.   

The bathroom floor was clean but not the toilet or dirty, slow draining sink.  There was dirt around the faucet and around the sink that obviously had been there a while. The dirt around the faucet would need weeks to get that bad, so I cleaned it, and the garbage can lid was filled with dust and dirt--gross, I wasn't touching that.  

What does the kitchen look like?

Long story short, I have bad credit that I have been working on repairing for the past several years. I understand that with bad credit, it's hard to get much of anything... So now that my current car that I have purchased several years ago (and PAID OFF) had an A/C that wasn't repairable for the 2nd summer living in Phoenix, I decided it was time for a new car. 

I saved up well over $1,000.00, knowing I have bad credit and would need something to negotiate from a buy here pay here place. I found the Simple Car store from an ad they posted in Craigslist, and it appealed to me because they were close to my work and reported positive to credit card companies (apparently).

Last Thursday, July 30th, I went in, and was told I was ""Preapproved"" and could test drive any car in the lot. I was told with my amount down and what I was looking for (type of cars, payments, etc) that it would be ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM getting me a car, even today if I wanted.

I test drove two vehicles, one 2007 Pontiac G6 with 108k miles on it and also test drove a 2006(if I remember the year) Chevy Cobalt ..... The cobalt was in terrible shape, I can't believe they didn't clean up the interior better honestly. I told the girls after test driving both and looking at the other cars they had on the lot that the G6 would be the only one I was interested in honestly.

I was asked to talk with Alex, whom I was told was the sales manager. She did the paperwork, I gave her all of the personal information she asked me for and said I was APPROVED. I quickly called my boyfriend to come look at the vehicle and bring down a small amount of cash so we could put a hold on the car.... at this point it was too late in the evening to coordinate insurance, so I wanted to complete the sale the next day. I was asked to put $100 down on the car and she would have everything ready for me the next day. I was even given copies of the car info, the carfax, and the loan details that I was ""approved"" for from their financing since I had to do in-house financing with my credit. 

The next day at work there was so much back and forth details it was RIDICULOUS. I put the insurance on the car, only to have Alex text me in the middle of my work day to explain her OWNER declined my loan because of my work history (I just started a new job) and that I needed a cosigner? I ended up leaving work early just so I could go down and see just exactly what was going on..... THIS WAS RAISING A TON OF RED FLAGS FOR ME.

Let me point out also that their ads say all you need is $500 down. Alex tried saying I wanted the most expensive car on the lot so she would have to put me in something cheaper (aka the piece of crap filthy cobalt or something similar on their minimal lot)..... Not to mention the Kelly Blue Book price of the Pontiac G6 was $2,000.00 lower then what they were asking for, even at other dealerships in town and even at other buy-here-pay-here dealerships.

After we got back into this dealership, she said I would need to provide more money down to even get considered. I told her we could do this... We re-negotiated this Loan that I was already supposedly ""Approved"" for ((this is called a yo-yo scam people, look it up)).... After making us wait for an hour, she came back to tell me that once again I was denied the options I was trying to offer to work with THEM.... I thought dealerships were supposed to work with YOU??? I asked she refund the HOLDING FEE that I put down of $100 back on to our credit card and we walked out.....

THIS IS THE REASON I DECIDED TO PUT A BAD REVIEW TO THIS COMPANY ALSO:

Guys, I went to Cactus Jack's Auto, because they posted an ad on Craigslist for the same car: a 2007 Pontiac G6.... The one I ended up purchasing from Cactus Jacks the VERY NEXT DAY had over 20,000 less miles, and was actually $1,500.00 CHEAPER... The loan process took me literally 1 hour, I was approved and driving my new (better) car home. I ended up putting less money down and my payment/loan amount was for half of the time/durration then the one offered to me at ""SIMPLE-RIP-OFF-BULLCRAP-Car-STORE""...

I know its hard if you have bad credit or are trying to fix your old bad credit. Don't feel like you aren't worth it to still shop around and find a better place. They are out there, and this dealership IS NOT ONE OF THEM.....",7,pmo4cKMNtORU-aLWPz4ccg

Turns out his quote for plantation shutters was the same price installed as it would cost me to order them and install them myself!!  They were also substantially cheaper (by several thousand dollars) than going through Home Depot or Lowe's.  And these are Hunter-Douglas shutters, not some inexpensive knock-off.  He also suggested some good solutions for our large sliding glass door, and we have been very happy with our choices.  In addition, there is no pressure to ""up-sell"" you at all.

Amazing fresh, seasoned crinkle-cut fries. I mean, they're crinkle-cut fries, but try them. Seriously. I've never had Mac's fries, but I doubt they get much better than this.

Lightly battered yet crispy and flavorful fried pickles (edged out Mac's for my number 1 fried pickle, which was not an easy decision!)

Fried corn-good, but with the French fries and fried pickles, I probably would have enjoyed this corn freshly steamed/grilled better. Add salt-it makes it yummier. 

Macaroni and cheese. Not bad, uses more of a cheese sauce than melty/crusty/baked cheese. I prefer the latter, and depending on the day (i.e. Mac's isn't skimping on the cheese), Mac's has them beat.

The collard greens were sweet and yummy, but I felt like the serving was a little small. Mac's has a little more spice and tang to the sweetness, adding depth of flavor, but I did enjoy them and would order them again.

The baked beans were just okay to me. They had a little extra BBQ or smoked flavor, but they didn't stand out to me. I happen to love Mac's baked beans so the bar was very high, but I'd probably give them a 5/10, whereas Mac's gets a 10 out of 10 for me.

My son got the beef brisket the first time we went, but it was pretty fatty and from my perspective Mac's has amazing brisket. I got turkey the last time I went and it was okay, a little dry. The BBQ sauce was good though, which made up for it, almost.

Overall Sauceman's will be added to our list of BBQ choices, but probably only when I'm craving their fries and pickles.",0,jgLA8HnJOlpR6PQ_VldaeQ

The first time we visited this place it was late afternoon in early December 2016. We were still able to order off the lunch menu and got happy hour drink prices. Our group of 4 ordered a variety of pizzas and sandwiches with beer, wine and drinks. The combination of less expensive lunch prices and happy hour drink specials reduced the bill sufficiently to satisfy us for the just okay food. I would rate the lunch experience 3 stars.

This Saturday our same group of 4 arrived for an early dinner. We requested to sit inside because the wind was gusting up to 45 miles an hour outside. Once we were sat, we discovered that they had their fans blowing on high, so it was as if we were sitting in the wind. It took a while to get someone's attention (not our server, who was MIA most of the meal) and they finally turned down the fans. None of us liked our entrees. One entrée was sent back because the fish was severely overcooked and chicken marsala was ordered in its place. The marsala was in a sauce thickened with corn starch - seriously?? Is this a cheap Chinese restaurant? My NY Clam Sauce was too thin and the pasta was undercooked and served in a big clump. Neither of our dinning companions cared for their dishes either. I would rate the dinner experience 1 star.

This is not real Italian food - not even close. The food just isn't any good and it's WAY overpriced for what you get. You can tell that there is no love or care that goes in to the preparation of the food.

I usually wait about forty minutes, sometimes longer, after showing up on time. During the exam, we switch rooms and I get to wait some more, while dilated so I can't read and it's boring as hell. 

I get a detailed examination from a nurse and then Dr. Biber breezes through in a few minutes. I don't feel like I'm getting enough information about my eyes. 

There's usually a surprise ""hey this one thing we did wasn't covered by your insurance"" on the way out (2/3 of the last times I've been I think, different things each time). It would be cool if they let me know that before they did the procedure.

This last thing won't apply to most people who go there, but they recommended an expensive surgery to make my eyes better. Dr. Biber said 70% chance I would be able to see well again. Then on the day of the surgery, they tell me ""oh this is only to keep them from getting worse, there's a very small chance of improvement"".

It was the worst meal ever. Everything was way too salty and some of us ended up going to the restroom RIGHT AFTER. Doesn't that tell you something?

What I really appreciated was they didn't have any french fries and my brother LOVES french fries so our server went to tell the chef to make us some french fries. She brought this big bowl of french fries and I really appreciate this kind gesture. The amount of fries was enormous and the fries were pretty salty but the gesture was hands down out of this world. I could not believe the kindess we got from the server.

We ordered very forgettable food, and I remember my breakfast bowl was out of avocados, so I just told the person behind the counter to 'surprise me' with an alternative (I think I got extra of something altho I couldn't tell).

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef ""devil dawgs"" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.",39,n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew

I say that because I had tried several times to come here, but they were closed whenever I'd think of them or they don't answer their phones when I've called to expedite service. So I hopped in the car & drove on over alone. Coming from North Las Vegas down Lamb to this side of town is a drastic change in environment. For Chicago people let me describe this as coming from Oak Brook to the worst Chicago project ever. I saw drug transactions, several prostitutes w/ass hanging out their dresses. It was a very LIT environment.  I'm from the hood, never above the hood, but just be aware!

The environment clearly doesn't deter patrons, at 130ish the place was still jumping with new and old customers. I browsed the menu and decided on 20pc wing lemon pepper & flaming hot, 2pc chicken snack, & a side order of gizzards. YES, IT WAS ALL MINE! Hell I wanted to try it all just in case I never come back, lol. After a 20min wait my order was ready, the lady shows you your order to confirm accuracy, so when looking at mine I don't see my flaming hot wings. I don't recall if she rang them up or not and after the hunger pains & long ass wait I don't inquire I grab my shit & go! 

Driving back down Lamb I'm eating omw too and I started w/the gizzards. Very fresh & hot! I didn't like the seasoning they added to them. I would've preferred none or lemon pepper, so those got disgarded quickly. Next I hit the lemon pepper wings FRIED TOO HARD! Taste was very good, but they should've been pulled up sooner. I saved the last 2pc chicken snack which was a thigh & leg for last. It was extra fresh & juicy, but again that seasoning from the gizzards was present. It's like a chipotle seasoning that's gross to me. So I ate the thigh, but nothing else. I left the rest for my kids who didn't eat any of it. Lol I would return for the flavored wings only.

The place could use a bit of help on the 'atmosphere' front ... I think for the whole time of my meal, there was some non-descript sitar music playing in the background, and some of the staff looked like their mother had just died ... but I could live with that if the food were ok. 

I ordered Lamb Vindaloo.  It was awful. Vindaloo is notorious for being hot (spicy hot), so when I order it, I don't mind if the waiter verifies I want it hot, but if they don't ask (they didn't this time) I expect to have a mouth-burning experience.  It was utterly bland.  Not only was it bland, but it was lacking in any of the 'vinegar' flavor I've experienced with all the Vindaloo's I've had elsewhere.

This has absolutely nothing to do w/ bathroom tub caulking; ceiling fan squeaks; pristine pool facilities; loud or quiet neighbors; excessive leaf blowing vs. excessive leaves; excellent, exclusive, taxpayer-rebate-funded (parochial/cult) schools vs. traditionally funded and notoriously neglected (pubic) schools for normal kids; creepy cupboard crawlies or any other such weighty matters.

I'd like to thank Wes, a member of the Village at Lakewood office staff, for his professional and discrete handling of an extremely urgent matter that a clearly distraught, non-resident walk-in dumped on his Monday morning desk.

Without hesitation and with some authority (no doubt guided by his years of industry experience) Wes rose to the occasion, followed procedure, enlisted the resources of the community, directed activities as necessary and calmly offered comfort and assistance to this complete stranger under duress.

Here's where I pull off my ""Undercover Boss"" disguise and present Wes with a full year membership to the ""Jelly of the Month Club"", right?  Hold on a sec...

My seafood dish had catfish that was slimy and disgusting, and the squid was rubber.  Seriously like a tire. They use red pepper flakes to spice their food not thai chilies.

I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...

Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! 

Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  

Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! 

The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. 

Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it.

A fellow volunteer at an event I was working on mentioned that her husband did estate planning and it might be worthwhile to check out even though I am in the east valley and the office was in Glendale. 

I can assure you it was such an easy and carefree experience that I cannot believe I was actually seeing a lawyer. I always pictured it being so complicated and expensive and having things said to me I wouldn't understand without use of a legal jargon dictionary. However, Heath sat down with me and discussed the different types of documents that were available and what they were used for as well as answered any questions I had in regard to them. He also asked questions about my affairs in order to create the documents needed. Ends up I just needed a simple estate planning package with a few different documents. 

I left that day giving Heath the information he needed to draft the documents. Since I didn't live nearby, he emailed me drafts of the documents when they were complete for me to review. I was able to ask any questions I had before hand and when I showed up to pick up the documents, all I had to do was sign and pay the small fee that was charged. Witnesses were available and everything was painless. 

I highly recommend visiting Heath for any estate planning needs.",5,5V8eXkTJb6IejJkMDaj_Bw

First time was a bubble on front passenger tire's side wall. They wouldn't want to cover it under warranty even it's a defect. We end up paid $358.12 to get a tire and installed by them.
The second time was happened few days ago. The front driver side tire blew out from the side wall and almost caught an accident on highway 404. There was nothing on the highway can cause a damage on the side wall of tire. When we tolled our mini to Mini Downtown, they refused to warranty the defect tire again. This time, we paid $362.91 to change the tire.
Two tires, both defect on the side wall and happened in one and half year. I am very disappoint of Mini's quality and service.  Will never purchase and recommend mini in my rest of my life.

cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg,0,2016-05-25 16:45:35,0,3Ul4BrRVGarGsf0tWXkMFA,"This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.

The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.

I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.

After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.

The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.

Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.

The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.

However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!",0,Usp0AbFpIkwe2ya3DAbZmQ

Gxu3_yzEAXKtkBB0YpnvlQ,3,2009-07-19,3,cIeF6K2kjNNkJ2pMKrGztA,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",6,5V8eXkTJb6IejJkMDaj_Bw

The food was magnificent, cheap cocktails that left a smile on our faces and would have easily had a few more, but had to drive :(

I called Pawsh Wash and they said they could take her if we could come in then. So I brought my dog in. While I was filling out the paper with my contact info. the groomer came to the other side of the counter and loved on my dog to gain her trust and then took her on the other side of the counter and let her off the leash. She said it would be 2 to 3 hours and that they close by 4. We left and ran some errands. As we were headed home we noticed it was close to 3:30 and so I called to check on her as it had been 3 hours. I was told she would be ready in 20 minutes. We were about 20 minutes away so we headed that direction. We arrived exactly 20 minutes later. I walked in, and this is the only reason they got 3 stars instead of four, the groomer told me I was rushing her and that they usually call when she would be done. I explained that I had called because she told me they closed at 4 and wanted to make sure I picked her up before then. She said okay and that was that. My dog is a lab so she does not get groomed, but the bath and nail trim etc. were very good. I would probably try this place again, because they did a good job.

Dark, more dark and darker still, its interior is either straight from the 1970s - I described in as ""the sort of bar one could see in the show 'Charlie's Angels' during the Farrah Fawcett era"" - or constructed to look like such. Either way, it's a huff of smokey air in the pre-fab, ""let's have consumer-driven fun"" world of Las Vegas. The enclosed, circular fireplace in the center of the first room is a nice touch and, along with the votive candles on the tables, a good source of light. If you're anti-hipster (whether patron or staff), this probably isn't the place for you, since a chunk of the crowd and the workers are dressed in dark clothing and sneaker-shod, have varying degrees of body art, slouch, smoke and possess a disaffected stare. Like Don't Tell Mama, this place is much easier to access if you start early (around 8 or 9 p.m.), especially on the weekend. While there are available street spots in this part of downtown, many of the reviews mention using a pay lot; this wasn't an issue for us, as we were staying at the El Cortez, just down the street and the hotel had ample parking in its structure. Please note that there was a supposed credit card minimum when we were in on Saturday, 5/19/12, which was $15, so my friend bought a shot. The crowd seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly and the noise level was low enough to accommodate conversation (again, remember we were here between 9 and 10 p.m. on a Saturday). Good jukebox with indie stuff - big surprise! - and no cover make this a no-brainer, especially for someone who opts for a downtown hotel stay instead of the strip.

I asked him some technical questions with no intent to purchase a system.  A follow up meeting at my house by one of the sales team answered my remaining questions.  It seemed almost too good so I told them I would think about it.  I called some of the other solar installers in Las Vegas and told them the deal.   They told me that they couldn't even come close and would not return my calls for a formal quote.  Yes, that is absolutely true!

We opted to buy out the lease outright which gives us a solar system for 20 years with free maintenance and support the whole time.  The equipment is theirs but I think it's much like a cell phone.  You'll want to upgrade before the end of 20 years anyways.  I calculate my cost to be 8.55 cents per kw/hr compared to that of 13.1 cents per kw/hr of NV Energy.  We only get a $14 bill from the power company now; which is well worth it for the net metering service they provide (which means every ounce of unused solar power produced by the system can be sent to the grid for later use) .  No other costs as everything for the next 20 years was paid upfront.    

I know they are new in town and they wanted to make a good impression with the new trucks and equipment, but they followed through with installers that were exceptionally professional.  They kept me informed during every part of the installation.   They installed the system in only a few days and I was very happy with the end result; both with the solar panel placement on the roof and the inverter placement inside the garage (my preference).

Because I signed up when they were at Costco, we received coupons for free Costco membership renewal and a $500 Costco card.   It takes a while to get both, but they came without me asking for them.

I just couldn't be happier and I don't normally write reviews.  I do, however, use Yelp a lot to decide on services for the house, so I just thought I would take a few minutes and contribute.  I would do this again with SunRun ""in a minute"".  Take a bow SunRun.",0,X65hVqCXd5ukNhtb-PpiaA

Items ordered:

- Potato Twisters:  It was fun to see a huge pile of carby-goodness.  A bit of a smokey taste.  If you like a softer version of kettle chips, this one is for you. 

- Southwest Chicken Salad:  Nothing spectacular.  The lettuce which composed most of the salad was a bit bitter.  It would've been better if more of the ""other"" items listed on the menu were present.

- Mini burger sampler:  
The turkey burger was tastiest of all 3 (IMO).
Beef burger was standard for a sit down restaurant.  
Ahi burger didn't have enough ahi.  It was two thin slices.  So, you were biting mostly into bread.  

- Captain Hook Burger (Fried Cod):  The crust was very salty, but the crispiness of the fish was excellent. I didn't care for the sweet relish.

- Iced Tea:  perfect.... freshly brewed 


Service:  very slow (They need to hire a runner to deliver the food to the tables... especially since they sold over 1000 GroupOn deals.)

Price:  Pricier than Smash Burger for about the same quality just nicer ambiance

Ambiance:  A fun place to go on a casual date.  Cute decor (contemporary cowboy?)  The booths are great for really tall people.  For short people like me, it felt like I saw sinking in the seat and had to sit up to reach the table.

Clam chowder
Prime Rib Sandwich
French Onion Soup

I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal. 

I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer.

I am so glad that you have responded to this serious concern.  I am 100% in agreement with you that this criminal, damaging, abusing and neglecting behavior from your staff and your director is not a reflection of Kindercare standards. Actually is not a reflection or should be the norm to any place where the safety of a child should be #1 priority

We have taken this to a higher power and the law. We have parents and a numerous amount of teachers that are leaving your center as I type this document, ready to testify. 

Go ahead and try to delete every comment I make. I have saved all correspondence and your director needs to stop pretending to pose as a parent. We saved her Yelp comment and it will be subpoena that she posed as a parent to validate a crime based on pay

The claims cannot be unsubstantiated just based on your statements. I do not need to get contacted by the leadership team, since Erika didn't seem to care for four days to call me back. Darby did not ever call me once after these horrendous incidents happened to my child, and at this point this has been taken into a legal level. I am concerned about what your staff is saying to you, and you may have the best intention as the franchise owner. However, I have several parents with similar situations that are pulling their kids out, and now we are going into a CIVIL CLASS AUCTION. I suggest that you consult with you attorney before you continue to respond. Anything that we say can be used in the court of law. The reality is that you also have a huge turnover of teachers that are leaving as I type this message. Many of them ready to testify and see how ""unsubstantiated these claims truly are"". They will not only back every single claim from every single parent from this forum, but they will speak their truth. 
It is time that the abuse and discrimination comes to an end. Also, notify your center director that before she decides to create a fake yelp account (response that was taken down right after, but I saved). That all IP addresses and posts can be subpoena in any forum to see where the note was originally posted from. I am not sure if your parents have access to the computers at your kinder care to create responses on Yelp, but it would be interesting to see why someone created a fake ID and decided to response posing as a parent. 
Please install cameras in your center with audio. I suggest that you start spending some funds and allocating safety precautions into the safety of the children as you state, not just with words, but with actions. You may be shocked with the abuse that is happening at your center without your knowledge. I will be contacting Kinder-care through all the parents legal counsel from this point forward and I do not need any of this rehearsed non sense to appeased people, cover the crimes and meet affiliated standards. There are things that have happened that can be proven and you cannot take away or hide. 

Today 05/24/2017 you sent this same response to me via Facebook through your page. We received a numerous amounts of emails and direct messages from that response of yours THANK YOU!

We have now more teachers and parents that are advocates to child safety and we hope that for the sake of the kids you look into these serious claims and allegations. 

- The teachers are being disrespected and fired on the spot by lies and the abusers are allowed to care for children. 

- I have teachers with proof ready to submit the above claims and support the yelling, ear pulling, insulting and child abuse that is happening in your center

- Parents and teachers have witness Darby showing up drunk from the night before. How do you expect an alcoholic to care about child's safety?

Please spend some money in cameras with audio to make sure you get your story straight and see what's truly happening behind your bank",5,tL8GPrqZZLJjtfj0Hp6DHA

If you're looking for gym, tan, laundry and fist pumping boys you're at the wrong show.  Just sayin. haha    I def. recommend JB if you're looking to be entertained by something other than a cirque, magic or boobie show.   

Tickets:  We ended up just purchasing our tix from the Paris desk since we were staying at the Paris.  Too lazy to go to discount tix or look for cheaper ones.  We got the cheapest tickets which were around 60 bucks.  FYI:  I heard the couple next to us ask if they had senior citizen discounts and they were hooked up.  Score!

Venue:  Any seat is good since it's not a huge venue.  There aren't any funky columns or obstructions anywhere so no chance of having to watch with your neck turned at a 90 deg angle.  We were sitting the 3rd or 4th row from the back and it was fine.  So unless you feel the need to be up close and personal you're fine getting the cheap seats.

Show:   I know I'm getting older when I want to hear music my 63 and 65 year old parents listen to!  Hubs and I were like one of the youngest couples there (in our 30s) but age is nothing but a numba here.  I won't go into details since you should see it for yourself but I will be honest, the beginning is kinda boring.  I remember whispering to the hubs it better pick up or I was ready to take a nappy nap.  But after 15-20 minutes it picks up.  JB is all about how Frankie became Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons via acting, dancing, and great singing.  I was actually surprised by how many of their hits I knew! So sit back, relax, and enjoy!

When we returned to the home, several of the units made strange noises. When we reached out - they were only concerned with having us buy an annual contract and no concern to hear why we wanted them out.

Was greeted by a woman who asked if we wanted a dozen. We opted for a half dozen. $6.91 was our total. The maple bacon donut was extremely fresh. Wonderful, the maple glaze was sweet but the bacon salty. Perfection. Apple fritter crunchy on the outside soft and gooey on the inside. My son really liked his chocolate long john.

All of our donuts were fresh and tasty except the raised pink frosted sprinkle. We think it was a day old. The customer service could have been a little friendlier but overall was a good donut experience and we will return.",0,N-WO-n6-AyVzdROSzhx5rA

After enjoying a $7 IPA and a $10 cocktail at Desoto... we decided we wanted a decently priced Bloody Mary. So, my roommate suggested Carly's. I guess they used to have $4 BM's on Sunday's? But that has changed to $6 now when you buy 2. Not bad since they add lots of garnish (if you're a veg head, make sure to ask for no meat or cheese). 

We also ordered the hummus trio which came with red pepper & regular hummus & this olive Tapenade (which is to die for!) served w/grilled flat bread & terra chips for $8.

Next, we ordered a Beermosa to share with a shot of Bourbon (for an extra $2)! I definitely recommend it! Super strong and worth the $$!

However, once inside the store you're treated to a peaceful, clean, organic shopping experience where you can trust the food you're buying is excellent quality.  The fruit and veggie selection isn't as large as what Whole Foods offers, but what they have is ripe, ready to eat, and at a good price.  I most often find myself in FM for the bakery.  I buy a lot of their fresh breads, pies, cookies, muffins, and donuts.  Why?  Because they're absolutely delicious and not loaded with fillers and chemicals.  My family can enjoy the occasional treats and I don't have to spend hours in the kitchen baking.  The fresh meats are excellent.  The salads and sides are excellent, the take-home pizzas are winners.  This is a really nice store and very different from Giant Eagle.  The quality of GE's selection doesn't compare to FM, and the stress level in GE is almost the same as shopping in Wal-mart.  My experience is in FM is always stress-free and the other customers are friendly.

My wife and I wanted lunch as to avoid what we figured would be a large dinner crowd, so we arrived about 2:30.  It was quite busy, with a line at the cashier stand, however the line moved quickly.  The major bottleneck is the beverage station, it slows forward progress as diners fill their glasses.  As long as you're going to have servers that re-fill your drinks, you might as well have them serve the initial drink to avoid the delay at the front door.  

The price was good, I'm used to two-for-one deals at the casino buffets, so it was weird paying for both lunches, but the pricing was reasonable.

We were able to find a table with no difficulty, as it was seat yourself at that time.  The restaurant was clean, and tables were bussed frequently, with no piles of dirty plates or napkins cluttering the tables.  

The food was very good, some items were a little bland for my taste, such as the mexican dishes weren't as spicy as I would have liked.  The meatloaf was a hit for me and my wife, which we consider the best meatloaf of any buffet.  The steakburger sliders were very good too.  

We were very pleased with how often the food is rotated, I didn't see any old or dried out food on the buffet line.  We had to be careful when eating because the food was very hot, which is a plus!  I also like how you can watch the food preparation as you're eating.  It's nice to watch them cooking as your eating so you know the food is being handled well, and prepared fresh.

The desert area was very good as well.  Although it's hard to get to the fountains because of the volume of people trying to use them, it's almost always wall-to-wall people at the desert counter.  I can highly recommend the hand scooped ice cream too.

Lastly, everyone, even the other diners, were very friendly.  Everyone was observing proper line etiquette, and excusing themselves.  Not jumping in line, waiting patiently.  Such a nice change from buffets where the norm is the ""entitled"" elite who think they run the world and you must allow them to cut in front of you and in general ignore you.  It's nice to be seen and to be acknowledged and to use the people skills our parents taught us.  Oh, and there were a lot of servers, buss persons, and staff keeping everything running very smoothly.

As long as things stay the same at this location I'm quite sure it'll remain our favorite buffet in Las Vegas.",9,fsLjz-J6Wqim0AR-hKFX4w

Thai tea-awesome one of the best I've had, no skimping on the size, 1/2&1/2, sugar or flavor. Excellent!!
Gai mok- very excited as I've only had the fish ""version"" which is amazing. It wasn't steamed long enough and the middle was cold. It was ok, but overall wouldn't get it again. The cold part just turned me off. 
Laab gai Lao style- was kinda sad they couldn't prepare it as a cold salad (which is how my nephew's Laotian family serves it and how I had it in Thailand) but they tried their best to accommodate although when I asked them to put it in the fridge after prep as it would be take out, I don't think they understood as the waitress said they don't have a fridge. 
Gai yang (bbq chicken) with papaya salad and sticky rice- outstanding, the chicken was boneless breast, well marinated, delicious, the sticky rice perfect along with a side of papaya salad, pefect, just like you would get in Thailand. Outstanding. Even the table next to me asked what I ordered and commented it looked very good.

I haven't written a review since the Brunch menu changed. My favourite Migas dish is no more, but it has been replaced by a new favourite - Shaksuka. Something that I've never heard of before, but have now had twice and love. It's so simple, yet so flavourful and always consistently good. 

The menu calls it spicy, but I'd disagree and just say well flavoured; it's not ""hot"" - maybe even a little sweet from the peppers and tomatoes. If you order it definitely add the lamb sausage. You get one links worth, about half the plate in size. It really makes the dish and adds substance to it - not optional in my opinion.

A friend ordered the cookie monster. It looked interesting! In the photograph it looked like it was served with a funnel cake. But when it arrived it was on a waffle. They could have told my friend they were out of funnel cakes that day. 

The thing I didn't like was, we had come in a group of 7. Service charge is automatically added for groups 6+ (10%), which was absolutely fine. Right before the bill was paid, our friend had asked if tips was included. To which the waitress had said yes. After the bill was paid, the waitress said the company takes the 10% and we need to add MORE for tips. The way that was handled and communicated could've been better. I did not want to leave anything at all after that.

Here is why, the corn tortillas they use are nice and thick and very very tasty. They are definitely of the street Taco variety so make sure you order enough, and my preference is the pork or pastor tacos, but both are very delicious. The meat is very tender, and the toppings are super fresh; you could taste the sweetness of the onion, you can taste the really ripe flavor of the guacamole and the Salsa's are well-balanced both in the medium and also the hot; a perfect mix of Smokey and Spice.

I thought I was saving a buck by not going to the mechanics that the insurance company recommended. I went through a Facebook group.  Well, he kept my vehicle 4 close to a year and kept claiming that the parts were hard to find and coming up with different excuses every time and this was with me calling on a daily basis! The final straw was when he said he was going to take my truck to another one of his friends shop to get the framework done. But he was very vague about where it was and could not even  give me a name or address. Finally I told him that just get the vehicle ready and I will be there to pick it up with the tow truck. He then sends me a text saying that I owe him $3,000 for disassembly fee. And the next morning I get a text saying that the truck is ready for me to pick up although it was still disassembled. Apparently, he checked and found that there's a lien on the vehicle.  So there was no way he could keep it. He still owes me for an airbag assembly. Later on I found out it was a higher-end vehicle. I didn't know it when I bought it. I think he saw the opportunity to make a scam because the day before I said I was going to pick it up he said he was going to take it to a friend of his to work on the frame but he wouldn't tell me where. Yes he is a cheat. And a very despicable person.

Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?

I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.

It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. 

After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. 

Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. 

Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**
A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.

**COURSE #1**
Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.

**COURSE #2**
Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.

**COURSE #3**
48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.

**COURSE #4**
Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. 

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**
Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.

After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.

This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.

If you subscribe to the ""you only live once"" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.",9,0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA

I'm not judging such fate as a ghastly act of mankind; it's just that in this neck of the woods, we have to take what we can get. 

If I was to rate this based on the single pour-over I have tasted from here, it would be a solid five stars. I was highly pleased to find that they had Akron Coffee on bar because Akron Coffee is the new best coffee in the [Akron] area. But it was my first time to try it so I played it safe with a Yirgacheffe pour-over which was said to have a pleasant balance of strawberries, cocoa and cinnamon. And yes, it was wow, quite pleasant indeed. It was very sweet and as it cooled it became increasingly buttery. In fact, the last of it got entirely cold and at that point it became one of the most butteryest, most smoothest, most bestest coffees I've ever slorked. In contrast, I sampled a bit of Oak Grove coffee of forgotten origin brewed via airpot, which was not so pleasant. 

They don't do espresso which is understandably a problem for some people. But for me, I find a bit of joy in seeing others as dedicated to high quality drip and filter coffee as I am myself. It's so much simpler that way and that's how these guys operate. A clean well designed coffee house with a simple menu is all anyone has ever needed. It's true. Less I better.

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.

A small and intimate restaurant on the Ossington strip, reservations could be hard to come by and our party of 7 had a strict 2.5 hours reso timeframe to follow. We practically ordered the full menu:

- Smoked mussels ($17): intriguing presentation of their mussels concealed by a cloud of smoke. The smokey taste was interesting but the mussels were too skinny and lacked their sweet juiciness.

- Cured trout over cedar branches ($15): again nice presentation but it ends about there.. The trout was tough and bland and the pieces were tiny.

- Venison and foie gras parfait ($15): if there was one thing I'd recommend it would be this - definitely the best dish we had from the menu. The foie gras parfait was sweet, light, silky and had a meaty savoury tanginess to it. 

- Pan roasted elk ($16): this was very tender with a great sear on them and worth trying as elk is not a regular menu item. 

- Pigeon pie ($24): first time having pigeon pie and I can't say I'm looking forward to the second. Literally just tasted like a regular meat pie.. And at $24 for a small pie it was quite forgettable.

There were some good dishes but nothing jumped out as a show stopper. Overall be prepared for small and dainty dishes that will take many plates (and $$) to fill you up. We also felt like it was a rushed dining experience and we were reminded to stick within our timeframe at various times.

They have an automated ATM machine like ticket ordering, ie, you don't talk to a person. I wasn't crazy about that. It wasn't as easy as I hoped it would be to find the show and time I wanted. But, I managed through it. And the ticket wasn't cheap, $12 a piece. But once in the theater it was super nice. We had reserved seating (you select your seat when you purchase your ticket). And the seats are nice recliners. Unfortunately, our movie was almost sold out and the only 2 tickets together were on the front row. That would have be very awkward, but the fully reclining seat let us recline back and thus the viewing angle to the screen was fine. Still a little awkward being so close to the screen, but it worked. The best thing here was the space you have in these nice chairs, you don't feel like you are sitting up next to a stranger.

I asked if they made any of their pastas in house and the only one that I was told was made fresh was the fettuccine so I substituted it in the garganelli carbonara dish. It was yummy. A good balance of pasta, sauce, chicken and spinach. I usually never have enough chicken for the pasta, but I actually had chicken and not pasta left. My boyfriend had the lasagna. I took one bite and thought it was really good. He said it had some hard chunks of tomato that he wasn't too fond of. We asked for more bread, which never came because it was frozen or something. We were told it was delayed, but it never came. 

We had the vanilla bean creme brulee and caramel creme brulee. It was served in these small tea cups which were the perfect size for an after dinner treat. The caramel was my favorite and they were only $2.45 each. 

I didn't try the bruschetta, but it looked delicious and I will definitely come back to try it. 

Please bring your patience. It took over an hour and a half to have dinner here and all we had were our pasta dishes and dessert (no appetizer or salads).",7,045lA8joqI1vPm0wLgZPKw

The chicken and koobideh rice platter was on the pricier side, $20 to be exact. The service was good just very very slow. It seemed as if the host was the only one working on the floor on the night that I came. He greeted, seated, took our drink and entree orders, brought out the food, refilled our waters, brought us our check and to-go boxes. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night and they figured it wouldn't be a busy one that they didn't need anyone else working on the floor? Aside from the slow service, they get an A+ for making their female patrons feel loved and appreciated at the end of their meal. Every woman is offered a long stem rose to take home with them.

My sales associate, Maddox Almon, was awesome.  Spent the time to go over all of the available chairs, sharing feedback from other clients who had purchased them in the past.  So many stores today just don't give you that specialized service, especially when it's just for one piece of furniture.

MM8n7SPaIuMlDGbUM5SZhA,0,2012-03-25,0,F0x5GUMMnaLNemJVLz0Jdg,"Wow! This theatre has redefined a night out at the movies. They've taken everything we dislike about most movie theatres and replaced it with a new way to cater to America's favorite obsession. Here are some examples (but you've gotta experience this for yourself to fully appreciate it):

Typical theatre: Get to the movie early so you can beat the crowds and find a good seat. 
Esplanade 14: Choose your seat beforehand (all seats same price)

Typical theatre: stand in line at the concession stand and give up a better seat or part of your movie and expect major price gouging. 
Esplanade 14: pay reasonably priced concessions from the comfort of your seat with the help of a server (included). 

Typical theatre: small, dirty/sticky, cloth seats with little leg room
Esplanade 14: big plush leather seats with a fold out table with so much leg room you should never touch the seat in front of you. And they were thinking large Americans here- No problems for the 300+ pounders. They won't be spilling over into the seat next to them.  These seats rock!...literally 

Typical theatre: various popcorn sizes and drink sizes all rediculously priced. 
Esplanade 14: one popcorn size 7.50 (free refills and large enough to feed anyone), one drink size (large with free refills). Not a rip off either. 

Typical theatre: $10-$11
Esplanade 14: $13 and probably should cost more. 

Only one negative thing to say:
I don't like the extra butter for my popcorn on the side in a small plastic cup. I don't know how to put it on like the specially trained concessions staff and it's difficult in the dark. The theatre should complete the preparation of the popcorn before it reaches your seat.",2,8Z57x0PSxdk2h2GB71wz7g

I went here for my bachelorette, though I didn't get dolled up in a crazy outfit and we couldn't afford the front row bottle service (which was like $300). We were kind of at a little table off to the side being less rowdy so we didn't get AS much attention from the dancers.

But it was still a pretty memorable experience.

We went on a Saturday night, when there was male stripping for ladies on one floor and male stripping for gay men on another. The dancers were all pretty well muscled and athletic. The stage seemed to alternate between the moderately talented and the really impressive ones. Some of the acts were cheesy, some of them were more raunchy. 

The VIP lounge wasn't quite what I'd expected. I have male friends who've been to regular strip clubs, so I thought the lap dance would have a lot of rules about touching or something...nope. ;) 

I think there was probably like 10 other bachelorettes going on at the same time, so there was quite a bit of screaming from rowdy ladies. Some of them were paying the dancers to drag their friends up on stage.

There is a very sweet girl that is usually working there, but I tend to steer clear of yolli pop when two idiot male staff (one couldn't figure out how to scan debit, so his buddy decided to help him out)  charged my boyfriends debit card $500,000 dollars for two yogurts totaling to $8.53. I don't even know how you would come up with that number. And yes, i did say $500,000. Needless to say, the bank froze his account for weeks until we finally figured out it wasn't bouncing, they shut it off for fraud. 
We talked to a manager, and she put us on the phone with the store owner. We gave him our name and number, and got 0 calls back about finding out what happened or given a receipt to give to our bank.

Second off its mid summer and over 90 degrees outside and it took over 20 min to get a pitcher of water and then another 15 for them to bring out glasses to go with the pitcher.

No complaints about the macarons themselves, they were delicious. I tried the lavender & apricot, coffee, ​and pistachio flavors. The coffee one was a little strong for my liking, but the other two were AMAZING. 

That said, the two staff members I encountered were very rude. I was taken aback by their lack of interest in communicating about the product and making the experience enjoyable for customers. Since I've heard such great things, this aspect was a huge letdown. 

Not sure if I'll return to this location for that reason, but can't disagree with the many reviews that confirm the macarons are super yummy!",1,DVOOF0Z627DyrZ4XKQbTgA

When we got home the fries where a little stale and corner of the sub was a little soggy but over all it was alright. Not worth $9. The subs from subway taste better then this and they're only $5. 

The calzone was the greasiest thing ever. It tasted alright but it was also kind of stale. It was pretty large. Maybe if it had been fresh made...

Oh and the ""ranch"" was SOOOOO WATERED DOWN LIKE MY GOODNESS. We opened it to pour some on the fries and it turned clear when it touched surface because it was so watered down.

Factors of annoyance: certainly the birds can catch you off guard a little; what can you say, they're jus .. Birds .. That's what they do.. Am not sure if the management could or should do anything about this, I don't have an opinion on this at this point, but left to me, I'd prefer not to have those birds super close to the food.

Gabriel was our waiter and he was terrific! Informative and good humored; simple enough you'd think, but those are two qualities that have become quite hard to find  of late at restaurants (yeah am talking about a bunch of other Vegas joints including Gordon Ramsay's burgr)

The weekday lunch buffet (at $14.95) is excellent, and even that comes with wine and beer.  The grilled New York steaks are heavenly, medium-rare to medium, just the right portion, and you can go back for more.  Rotisserie chicken, carve-to-order.  Several Thai and Vietnamese salads are uncommon elsewhere.  Many good Italian dishes, both hot and room-temp.  Overall, so many things are made well; it's about quality.

It no longer serves breakfast, so finding any eggs is difficult.  But if you look hard enough, you'll find chunks of egg in the Singapore noodles.

And, a make-to-order espresso bar that goes with all those sweets (tiny Tiramisù, crepes, crème brûlée...).  But the line can be long because desserts and coffee are in the same place; the person manning the espresso bar also has to scoop gelato.

Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas?

First off, the quality of the food has decreased significantly.  If you want good Mexican food, there are plenty of places to get it.  Likewise, the service in the cantina is weak.  I came in on a weekday for lunch, and there were not many customers in the cantina.  Still took almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter over, then another 10 to get a soda I had ordered. The table behind me was empty and sat unbussed for the entire 20 minutes, but the busboys walked by several times. I have worked in restaurants and I would have fired them for what I saw...

Once I got the food, it was okay, but I had to wait another 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention to get my check...

Final straw for me was going in today to watch football. I got in early to see where my game was showing.  They have signs on the TVs indicating which games were showing on each TV. Sat so I could see Raiders/Titans and Jags/Ravens. I was told in no uncertain terms that the TVs were not changing, and heard the bartender mention that as well.

Since then I've taken a lot of test drives and a lot of times the salesman talk all through the test drive and trying to point out stuff about the car. 

Harry sat in the back seat and took me on a drive that showed me how to make the most of the turning radius in the Subaru Impreza and how to get out of gravel without spinning the tires and how to backup using the backup camera and the trajectory angles to my advantage. I'm a nervous Nelly in the car and this guy gave me so much confidence about parking and doing three-point turns and accelerating. Since that test drive my overall driving proficiency has increased so much and my confidence. It was an added bonus that I did not expect.

There are six Subaru dealerships within a 20 Mi radius of my house. I talked to nearly all of them and drove a car at another Subaru dealership, a Kia dealership and a Mitsubishi dealership. 

Now in August we were just getting the funding together to make the purchase. I'd been to a lot of different dealerships including Kenny Ross (where I would never go again... check out their BBB rating) and and we came back and drove a Subaru Forester with Harry Gosnell.

The Forester was a bigger car and more suited to our family needs, but we felt that it was out of our price range. One of the managers, Garrett, gave us a deal that made it affordable for us. and this enabled us to get the premium with the heated seats and all of the bells and whistles that we could not afford before this deal.

We knew that we couldn't stay and make a deal that day and we had to leave the dealership and we were worried that they might pressure us to stay but they didn't.

We went home we talked about it and we decided to make a counter-offer to the dealership which we presented to them. They considered our offer and gave us a very good trade allowance on our car and a significant portion off of the price of the Forester that we bought, this deal brought both sides together and was more than acceptable to my husband and I.

When we came in to purchase the car they were able to take all of our information and schedule an appointment for us to meet with the finance person, Chris.

In the finance office Chris was very organized took all of our paperwork,  put it before us and explain each thing before we signed. He explain the various products that they sell in the finance office but never pressured us to buy anything. He told us that it was perfectly fine with him if we didn't pick up any of the extras at the end, all of which we skipped on. 

I am a spreadsheet and numbers person and all of the numbers added up and nothing extra was added. There were no dirty tricks. They cleaned up the car that we picked out and got it all ready for us while we were signing the paperwork.

I left there with a very positive feeling and a lot of thankfulness because I have been praying for a new car and it happened. God is good!",1,vJ2vvixDLqrfoPJPy-P0PA

I think we literally asked 10x for the edamame (as my 15 month old only eats that) and finally when we were done and ordered our ice cream and paid did they bring out the missing order. The food was meh, I know you can't expect much from AYCE but I' ve had better. The server even acknowledged that they were too busy and unprepared however when I mentioned the ""busyness"" of the night she said no it's always like this near the end of the week. The place was too crammed, We felt like a bunch of sardines. On a plus note, the bathroom was very clean!!!! Will I try this place out on a less busy day?

On our recent trip to LV, we stayed in Henderson, away from the hustle and bustle of the LV strip. Yelped a couple spots we wanted to check out for brunch and I am SO GLAD THAT WE MADE A STOP HERE AT SERVED. It wasn't packed when we arrived so we got seated right away. Our servers were exceptional. So friendly, so quick, and so personable. 

The establishment is small, hip, and very clean. Lots of parking and in a very nice neighborhood. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely be back there to try out the rest of the menu items. 

For this trip, I got the longanisa breakfast. Let me tell you... my belly was SO HAPPY. Something so simple, but was so delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the miso burger and he loved it. I look at the picture I took and I'm salivating over the thought of their food. You can be adventurous or a little more on the traditional side. Whatever floats your boat. 

All-in-all, it was definitely a great experience. No reason for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Excellent job, Served!

He says, ""Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!"" Uhm, there's that in this city? Am thinking, my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm, a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay, he picks me up and off we go. Initially, he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago, and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).

Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!

Like a ""starved"" woman, I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter, the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course, I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite, fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers, garlic, oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic, oh my! Then so, I got a hold of the oregano, hot red dried pepper, garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These, are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese. 

Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em, this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions, olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness, tasty tomato sauce, and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto, mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah, hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated, as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You, am talking to you! Go munch on a pizza yumm pizza!",8,l1CtGHiqB349YrmxjIcgng

The lamb tikka was very tender and extremely tasty. Only reason this isn't a 4 or 5 star is because the restaurant isn't very nice to look at. I went with my parents, my father being Iraqi, and according to him it has a very authentic Iraqi feel like any bar from back home, and the food was authentic too.

However, the front of the house has failed us twice and I give them zero stars.  On our first visit, we had a reservation and still had to wait.  They were overwhelmed and my girlfriend and I are understanding of dinner rushes so we didn't have a problem with it.  The food was delicious on our first visit and we just chalked it up as a one-off where it was just one of those busy rushes.

Fast forward to last Friday, 3/20, and we were seated and unable to even get a drink or bread.  This time, the restaurant wasn't even full.  After 20 minutes, I said to the hostess that I believe our waiter forgot about us.  She replied that he was double-sat tables.  The tables were outside and we were inside which could make her at fault which having a server have to run around an entire restaurant is incredibly inefficient.  As a former bartender/server, I understand how cumbersome this can be.  However, the hostess stating that he was double-sat tables essentially tells us that we are the least important of his tables.  She did politely take our drink order and after a total of 25 minutes, with only water at our table, we couldn't take it anymore and left. 

Since this is the second time this has happened, it's clear that the owners/managers are at fault for being too cheap to hire additional servers. Or, they're hiring servers that are inept at handling any sort of volume.  

In conclusion, the back of the house here rocks!  It's a shame that the front of the house is sinking the ship.  We've given them two times to get it together and they have failed us each time.

Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. 
The service and customer service here is exceptional. 

We tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. 
Most of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. 
The filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. 

When asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.",6,JuU-5VI0Kl5PG4v6LAkgyg

It was a nice day,  nice weather so at $50.00 for both of us,  we were okay - but just barely okay. A few suggestions for the event leaders: 1. Get a larger venue. The closeness of the crowd was very offsetting! 2. In addition to the marvelous local vegan restaurateurs, also approach national brands (Follow Your Heart, tofurky, Daiya, Morningstar, tuscon tamales, &c.) and have them attend.  3. Work out something different for people who pre-paid vs. those who need to purchase tickets at the event.  People with vip tickets were waiting in long lines with people who had not pre paid.

She was completely honest with me and warned me that it's possible that the screen would crack. She would need to have one on hand in case that happened.
I decided to have the screen replaced anyway, what I thought was a scratch was actually a giant crack. 
That worked out well! She gave me am amazing deal because I was replacing both parts.
She called me when the part was in, even gave me an after hours number to reach her. 
I dropped it off, had my phone back in less than an hour. 
A week later I thought I was having problems with my microphone,  turns out it was my face. Yeah, little embarrassing.  She was so kind, so nice and patient.  She can have an office full of people and is very patient and generous with her time but completely efficient.

I sent an email (didnt call as it was after hours) and had the installer on the phone within 10 minutes of the email! I typically expect a warranty issue to take days or longer (using the larger companies it takes an act of congress to get something fixed, about 10 years ago my corvette had a leak and it took 11 days to get that company back out to fix it and STILL had to fight with them as they insisted it was leaking somewhere else!) but in this case, even with christmas being the next day, they were out the day after christmas and came to my work to fix it. Customer service isnt easy to come by like this, and id rather deal with a small issue and have them own up to it and fix it than a big company that puts me off and treats me as another notch on the belt.

So this past weekend I got to visit Vegas for my birthday, and decided to pay oyster bar a visit. I knew the line was gonna be long so I specifically chose to come here early on Monday morning, I'm talking about 4 am type of early!
I walked in expecting to get seated right away and boy was I in for a surprise..... there was a line! Mind you it was 4am on a Monday, so I was completely in shock; ended up waiting for almost an hour to get seated!
Not gonna lie I was getting pretty frustrated with the wait so I had high expectations when it came to the food. I decided to order the combo pan roast with a spice level of 7 out of 10 and the three shooter special with vodka ($12). The shooters had quite a bit of vodka and nice chunk of oyster as well and the pan roast definitely lived up to the hype. The only problem I had with the pan roast was their use of previously frozen seafood but the flavor definitely makes up for this minor issue.

Overall verdict, oyster bar is definitely worth the wait. I just hope they can expand the place in the near future or hire another staff to offset the wait time a bit.",0,1XMjbZCLHk0BtdZRCvixHQ

Watched, ""Oz The Great and Powerful "" - 3D.  We were fired up about the notion of ""luxury"" seating since my daughter recently shared an experience at a similar theatre in southern california so we were hoping for the same.  Not quite but we still enjoyed the place.

Highlights:

- Like the fact that you can order and reserve the seat in advance ( but there is a $2 processing fee ) - movie cost $14/person. 

- The seats are very comfortable with electronic control to recline the chairs.  BIg surprise, the seat  is very comfortable.

- sound system is awesome.

- screen is HUGE

- I like that they require you to completely turn off the cell phones

Lowlights:

- wish they had ""loveseat"" style seating - it was kinda hard to get comfy with my girl

- Although the screen is huge, they should cut a few feet off the bottom.  Anytime someone stood up in the first few rows, their melons blocked a portion of the screen.

- expected full food service in the theatre

They have tables to be able to sit and decorate the childrens pumpkins and they also sell snacks and drinks. There are also two jump houses and plenty of shade with tables.

I have never paid this much for won ton of any taste level, not in San Francisco not in Portland Oregon not in San Diego. Overpriced and tastes bad.

We get seated and take a look at the menu. Another ten minutes pass before we see a server. She was really sweet but seemed new. She asks me if I want a dry rub on my wings. She explained it as they put dry rub on them before putting sauce on so I said sure. They came out with dry rub on them and nothing else, no sauce. Just covered in seasoning and fried, then covered with more seasoning. Pretty gross and unappetizing. 

We don't see her for quite a while. Our glasses are empty, one of my friends needs ranch, and our server is nowhere to be found. My boyfriend flags someone down, who ignores us. He gets our waiter who brings refills and ranch. She brought me the wrong drink, a Dr. Pepper instead of root beer.

I said yes and asked a question about a menu item I did not see in the menu that had been recommended.  I looked up and he was gone however.  He returned and... did the same thing again.

They brought me a salad, lay it in front of me and I asked if it was the melon salad.  I was told it was Caesar ?!  He took it and ran around the restaurant a few more times with it.  Five minutes later another runner said are you waiting on a salad? And laid down the very same salad in front of me.  I don't know whose it was but it visited several tables b4 u got it.  I told them I was waiting on the melon salad. He beer was gone, my friend had eaten his meal, the cheesecake was melting and covered in flies. Finally, after another 10 minutes went by and the cheesecake was inedible. I received my salad.
3. This was not a good salad. I don't know if they rushed it.  I don't know how many people had touched or become acquainted with it, or if it had originally had some feta or flavor that someone ate.  It was watermelon, tomato and cucumber with fresh ( but not at all flavor-filled) oregano and a sprinkle of feta with a weak balsamic on top.  The predominant flavor was cucumber.  Is that even a flavor? .  It looked pretty though.  It came with a mass of gyro meat.  That was tasty.

I have also lived in Chicago for a few years and I couldnt really tell a BIG difference between the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. 

I think given the location, it is very impressive that this orchestra is so successful right now. The music hall is just breathtakingly beautiful. I have been to 10+ concerts so far and there was no single concert that has let me down. One time, they had a jazz music event, called martini or something. It was one of the greatest experiences that I had with the fusion of classical and jazz music. Multiple music stars like Yoyo Ma and Joshua Bell have come to cleveland for performance as well. The players do rotate from time to time and yes minor errors are unavoidable but they are very minimal that I would not really frown on that.

If you are a student, they have a student fan card, which you can get for only $50 for a whole year's concert, except special events. If you catch the sale season, which is usually the first month of September or something, you only need to pay $25 for the same card. You do need to go get the student ticket at least 1 hour before the concert. I usually go a day or two before the concert.

For the main course I chose the Parmesan encrusted chicken with potato cakes and cheddar grits as a side. While the chicken was cooked perfectly I didn't like the flavors so I sent it back and got the beef short rib which was good. The potato cakes were also good, but the cheddar grits were bland and needed salt. Overall the food was pretty good but the customer service was impeccable.",0,fYBkpsjPhxXhkxD2ep4Vyg

The first time I was chuffed because I had a Groupon, but when we got there, I was stunned to discover the ""locals price"" was less than what I paid!. And just between you and me (do not tell anyone else!) Tuesday is half-price for locals. Yep, Two for the price of one. AND you can take your outta-town friends on your locals price -- one local ID can buy 4 tickets. Check it out !! 

That being said -- it is a fun thing to do and NOT scary. Do not be afraid to do this. I am terrified of heights -- chickened out of the zip line at the Rio, but this is not a ""ferris wheel."" It is a spacious enclosed cabin that moves so slowly that you don't feel it at all. 

One time we did the half-hour-happy hour and the Groupon was good for that because even though we are not big drinkers, we managed to slug back 3 drinks each, so that was a good deal. The bartender was delightful and told us all kinds of inside info on the wheel -- like for instance, what happens if someone has a heart attack or gets seriously ill? How fast can they whip this puppy around in an emergency?

One time, just by chance, we got there at dusk -- paid the daytime price, but got to see the sun set over the mountains. Beautiful. I've been there at night and also in the day time. It's lovely every time. 

This really is a Las Vegas treasure. Treat yourself. 

OH -- and wait -- after you get off, walk back toward the parking area and there is a big machine where you can take your own picture and post it right to Facebook. Check it out!",0,Jy9LdvAHx39Jk8mZS6bm0g

The restaurant is spacious with enough seating. The tables seems to cater to larger groups. The place is busy but seating opens up fairly quickly. The restaurant's washrooms are small but clean. 

We ordered the Pho House Special, Bun Bo Hue and the Grilled Pork Chop with Shredded Pork, Rice and Vegetables. Each dish came in large portions. The prices were fair. Service is attentive enough as you shouldn't expect to trade pleasantries with the waitstaff. You write down your order, they pick it up and bring you the food. Make sure that you inform them whether you want tea or cold water in between those interactions. Otherwise, they don't come to your table to see how is your meal.

- Modern fastfood, modern only in name, high price being its true differentiator (relative to twin arches).  

- Small seating area accommodates those wishing to dwell...Kitty corner view of TV at neighboring edtablishment

We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.  I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member). When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly. How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size. The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual. They seated us promptly (no waiting). There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch. He was so nice! Now comes the food part. It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order. Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables. The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing. Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant. I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table. So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.  And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff. I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs. All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'. But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning. And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size). Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe. (One member of the party had to order special for their diet). Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed. After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill. My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed. The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress).

I didn't request a specific doctor , however I was scheduled with Dr. Giedraitis. The staff was very friendly and got me in the same week. I did read reviews on a variety of review sites out of curiosity as my back ground is in Medical/ Cosmetic Practice Consulting. There weren't many but what I could find mostly focused on negative bedside manner. This didn't phase me because having worked and consulted with hundreds of physicians my personal opinion on bedside manner doesn't sway my decision on choosing a doctor. I mostly care that the doctor listens, explains and sets up a plan to address my problems and doesn't make me feel unimportant. Bottom line. If they can do that in 10 minutes or if it takes 30 minutes I don't care. He did exactly what I needed without all the fluff and basically straight to the point. That's what I care about. His bedside manner was never an issue and I personally feel patients put too much emphasis on this overall. Are you inviting your doctor to Thanksgiving dinner or do you want your issues addressed?  Doctors are people too and have a tremendous responsibility and schedule. No one has perfect days and Doctors minds work a lot different than others. They are scientists as well as a businessman/woman. They have families and responsibilities like we all do. Do your part as the patient so doctors can do theirs to best care for you. They have multiple patients, multiple procedures, meetings, documentation,  protocol to follow that constantly is being changed by the government and FDA. Tests to order, tests to read, patients to refer, doctors to correspond with, partners to work with and employees to rely on for a smooth daily process and not to mention Insurance companies who want to only pay pennies on the dollar and then they write off thousands of dollars for work done that they won't get paid for. It's not the glamorous high life. Long story short.... if your doctor seems rushed there's a reason... if you have questions they can't read your mind, if you want warm and fuzzy get a kitten. If you want a good , qualified doctor get referrals,  research and check their history. 

Personally, I think Dr. G has a fine bedside manner. I feel he is focused on the best approach for his patients and he explained my condition and options in detail and he did listen to my concerns and addressed them accordingly. Everything was seamless and I have had my appointments, tests, follow ups and procedures schedule all within days of each other. 

Dr. G actually compared a past xray I had and read the report and found that the radiologist missed something and he took new x-rays to compare and showed me what was missed and set me up for an MRI with specific instructions to the technician to focus on the area in question and get a better look into the area that was overlooked. This to me is far more important than the warm and fuzzies.

I appreciate their flexibility and getting me schedule in a timely manner and I'm extremely grateful that there is a plan in place to address my extreme back pain and I'm looking forward to regaining a better quality of life with the professional guidance of Dr.G.

He told the lady doing his hair that we were  getting pictures. After she started coloring his hair she said this was her first time doing a beard and then said he shouldn't be doing it the day of. The first color she mixed up was too red and he told her but she said it will look good. It came out red!! She redid it with a darker color but did it soooo sloppy. There was dye on his forehead!! I made him walk across the street to La Lou and they took care of it there. They cleaned up the dye and blended it into his hair better. But my godddd how incompetent can you be!

I have been a chef for 30 years. When I do dine out of course expectations are high. This was for my wife birthday. We have been married for 32 years (yeah as long as I've been cooking). I will bypass the service, waiter was just sub par. Not bad but not great. On to the food. Menu is small plate driven which is what I wanted for us. Order a few and then some. Well, our waiter brought the first 2 courses on 2 boards. We were in no hurry, so why bring them at the same time? Then not even half way through the next one came. I asked waiter to take it back until we were done with first 2. My wife could see the kitchen and that were off set (they don't want it?).  Anyway, we enjoyed what we had. Baba gnouch and ceviche. both outstanding. Then the braised bison with a bunch of goodies and purees.(phenomenal). Does it get better? Next was the Kobe beef tartar with a perfectly cooked soft egg on top with croutons. ( chef note. Good but needed more mustard and capers, perhaps brandy). Then we asked for the menu to order one entree. My wife asked the waiter what he suggested. Bacon wrapped waaaabbbbbitttttt. She said sold. After first plates coming out toooooo fast. The waaabbbbiiiitttyyy took a long time. But it was totally worth the wait. (Again phenomenal). OK,now one bad for our waiter. We listen to another waiter totally blow his table away with dinner descriptions! Always us! Figures! Out waiter didn't even pour our wine during our stay. Really? Wtf. At 55 bucks at least make us feel welcomed. Then we had desert. Pineapple upside down cake with house made ice cream. (Both of us in bliss and I don't eat desserts at all). So you say does this review make merrit? I am a professor teaching culinary arts to the up and coming folks. My final tally, get me an awesome waiter, cause chefs food was too die for!

It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little ""neighborhood gem"" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.  

I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Solé Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Miró Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Solé was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.  

HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Solé, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience.",4,aHreiNwuRfCi91StteULeA

My husband and I chose to bring his parents here tonight, they are from PA, frequent Rehobeth Beach, DE, and they raved how some of what they ate parelled what they get ""at the shore""!  

For aps, my husband had the clams casino, my father-in-law had the wings, I had the ceviche, all excellent!  For dinner mother-in-law had the fish n' chips, father-in-law and husband had the harvest platter, I had the enchiladas with crab...amazing!  My MIL wanted the fish tacos, but she chose last minute the fish n' chips, and she loved it.  The boys loved the platter, although the crab cakes were less than desireable, and my enchiladas were the best seafood enchiladas I've ever had.  I have compared them to Maria Maria's crab enchilada suizas, these stand out beyond them.  

This place is like a sleeping secret, and I wanted to share this place should not be overlooked.  Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!  

No more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.  I love the Salt Cellar, but they have since raised their rates through the roof, we looked for less pricey, and they serve up just as amazing food.

My husband had the Jumbalaya Pasta and he said it was really good. The sausage could have been more spicy but my husband really loves his food spicy. There were 5 shrimp, nice sized and not over cooked.  He also had a cup of the Steak Chili as his starter

He enjoyed that chili and told me that the next time he wants to have the stuffed baked potato with the Steak Chili.  So it must have been good!

My mother and I had both had a cup of their Clam Chowder, which is still yummy as on our previous visits

We had the Club House Sandwich.  I really liked that garlic aioli, however my mother thought it was strong.  Keep in mind that my mother is 82 yrs young and her taste buds have been changing as she's gotten a little older.

We both loved those shoe string fries

The only time we get to eat at Claim Jumpers is when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.  We normally go to the one located on Charleston, on our way back from Redrock but since we were at the Golden Nugget we decided to eat at this Claim Jumper

We had a late lunch so it was not crowded at all.

This is were my biggest complaint comes in:  The service was horrible!!!

My husband asked for iced tea, the server said that they only had Tropical Iced Tea.  My husband asked what was in it.
The response:  I don't know, just order it

I was about to say something but my husband squeezed my hand to signal me to bite my tongue. 

He did go ahead and order it and he said it was ok.

We got our soup and our server advised us that we would have a different server going forward.

Our food came but we were still eating the soup.  So the new server had to move things around to put the plates on the table.

My mother had hot tea and she had asked for more hot water.  

My husband asked for hot sauce

Server said he would bring it right over.  

He was helping other tables, going back and forth, so we waited.  

I noticed a bottle of hot sauce on an empty table nearby so I got it for my husband

We had finished eating and there was still no hot water

So I got up and walked all the way in the back and asked for the hot water

They acted so offended that I came to get the hot water.  I told them just give me the hot water.  A different server refused to give it to me and insisted that the hot water would be brought to us.  

I didn't think it was a problem to go get it but they made it seemed like I committed a felony.  So this really made me irritated.

Our server brought over the hot water a few minutes later

He then had the nerve to grumble to my mother about the food left on her plate.  I told my mom to ignore him because I could tell by her expression that she felt bad.  She ate half of her food and for us that is a good thing.

At this point, my husband got upset so he left only a $3.00 on $69.00 tab

Having worked in food service my husband normally tips 20% but this guy was just straight up rude.

We will eat at Claim Jumper again but not at the one in Golden Nugget

We will go back to the one on Charleston since we've always had great service from them!

And Haru really deserves it.

Yes I live in McKenzie, but there's no bias - just sheer luck to have a great sushi place in the neighbourhood. I'd drive long distances if needed, glad I can just walk in.

Service is the best part of the experience - these guys are genuine, attentive, polite, and just fun to deal with - always smiling, friendly, jumping in to fulfil every need you may possibly have.

Good menu. I guess I've eaten all of it back and forth, and would love to see more items on it, but still - good stuff, enough to choose from for a while.

Needless to say, I've been to Haru almost every other weekend for more than a year, and neither me nor my wife had ever encounter something that won't be fresh and carefully prepared. We love that.

Another big plus is that Haru folks are so accommodating - when we arrive with our little one, they always help moving a stroller so it won't bother anyone, and give us a table which allows stuffing the baby seat in.

And the most important, it's not just about us, our family - we regularly observe the same level of respect and attention to the rest of the customers.

Good job Haru, and thanks for all the fish! ;-)

Well not yet though, as we'd surely return again and again...",2,z6VZrWNIAVw8Nv1w065tLg

There is one spot in chicago that does similar sandwiches with fries and cole slaw with the bread between the meat so I had a little experience before this visit.  I got two sandwiches the cheese steak and the corned beef.  both we very bad.  Bread was fresh, fries were hot but that is about it.  every bite all i tasted was fries with an after taste of sweet slaw.  the steak in the cheese steak  tasted like it was made in a microwave.  the meat had to have been bought at a local grocery store because it was as bland as bland gets.   

I guess it's my fault for getting the corned beef.  why would a place in the middle of freaking PA have a good corned beef sandwich.  they didn't, took one bite and threw it out.  beef was very dry and the overwhelming taste of the fries and slaw once again dominated the tasteless flavor. 

before both sandwiches found the garbage i pulled the meat out to taste separately in case i missed something, i didn't.  complete waste of time, money and what could have been a more flavorful experience at a nearby Jimmy Johns",2,sAQvIq6U3quQam53w_yHog

Their chicken dinner is a pretty decent deal, I'll likely get that on Foodora the next time we are home and want healthy takeout.   Or I'm happy just getting a few roast chickens and cooking my own sides when guests come, and then say I did it because, how would they know?  :-P

I've been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did! I have a weak spot for Chinese take out, and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation. 
I left this morning to find a menu to My House on my doorstep..... I took this as a sign that I HAVE to try this for dinner. I had plenty of time to peruse the menu, and decided on walnut shrimp, green jade vegetables, and crab rangoons.

Here's my verdict on each of my menu items I ordered:

Walnut Shrimp - generous portion! Large shrimp,  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own. Complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce. I especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce. It allowed for the other flavors to shine through.

Green Jade Vegetables - as you may have guessed it.... this is an entree of green veggies. Green beans, broccoli, snap peas tossed in a white sauce. Again, lightly sauced not soaking in sauce. Very flavorful for a side of veggies, I was pleasantly surprised.

Crab Rangoons - Aahhhh yes, crab rangoons, my guilty pleasure. One of the deciding factors I consider whether I will return to a Chinese  restaurant is how much I like their crab rangoons.  These were top notch. The wonton wrappers were fried perfectly. Light crunch, good texture.... not hard or too chewy. The cream cheese filling was seasoned/ filled with something magical that I thoroughly enjoyed.

When I asked the server what the $4.99 was, he told me it's because my daughter ate. I told him that my daughter is not even 1 year old, she is only 9 Months, why am I getting charged $5 dollars for it? His response was because ""she ate"". My daughter can't even eat a lot, she had a little bit of rice and small pieces of salmon teriyaki. Still the server was still arguing that I had to pay because she ate. I told him, most restaurants ONLY charge $2.99 for children who are 2 years and older. Which I can understand, because at that age, most children can properly eat, but $4.99..... for not even eating half of a bowl of rice, that's just ridiculous!

Take the 215 to Jones and drive until you think you are out of the city limits, just kidding (sort of).  This location is not ideal, but it is well worth the extra effort.  We sat at the sushi bar and were treated like royalty.  All of the staff seemed very happy to take care of us and service was spot on.  In this commercialized, sometimes generic city, I am a sucker for pride of ownership.  The owner, John, was behind the bar serving up amazing fish.  He stopped to chat and really made our experience a great one.  

I cannot stress enough that every single thing we had was awesome.  The two stand-outs were probably the salmon wasabi (crème fraiche on salmon?!?! yummy!) and the bomb oysters, but it is really hard to pick favorites because it was all delish.

stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later.

So the food:

I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out.

There is a comfy sectional couch with a single pull out bed, a tv in the bathroom and many other amenities. 

The elevators are really fast.

My biggest complaint is that when we ordered towels, a blanket and extra pillows, it took 1.5 hrs to receive, which was so long that even the Priority Card center called in to check on us to make sure we received. What made it worse was that when I called in after 45 minutes of waiting, the housekeeping lady that picked up claimed I only called in 20  minutes ago, but that was actually just the time she decided to put in my order. This made us miss meeting our friends at another casino, which obviously ruined our experience.

I thought I didn't need to as the food and reputation should speak for itself. Then I finally read some reviews and now feel I NEED to do one. So, I started coming here when Ibby's moved to new management and Antoine took over. My husband told me we should try it, and so we did and have been coming here ever since. All food is cooked to order, which I love way better than chicken or fish that sits under a lamp! So this means it will be a minimum of 10 mins and that's okay with me. My food has always been delicious, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I can speak to the juiciness of the fried chicken and delicious baked smothered turkey legs. The rice is amazing and I'm really picky about my rice as I prefer Jasmine. The gravy is amazing to not have any flour in it! I don't do cheese so I can't speak to the macaroni and cheese taste, but my husband and kids love it! The macaroni from what I hear has changed along the way and I think that's because Ibby's listens to their patrons and learns from any past inconsistencies. I love that with every meal you get a free drink and I believe the prices fall in line with soul food/fish fry places from where I'm from which is the Bay Area. The generous 3 sides with dinners are very filling. The greens are clean, tasty and not runny and freezer-like and not over seasoned. When I come here I have many dishes. Usually when I have a place that I love to go to I only have one dish that's my favorite. At Ibby's on any given day I can order from at least 5 different meals. I love the catfish, the fried chicken, the baked chicken, the baked turkey legs and shrimp! The sweet potatoes and cobbler are my favs as well and you will not be disappointed! I've also been to other restaurants nearby (Ezekiel's/LoLo's) and I honestly can't find one that compares. When we first started going there I was really antisocial. But everyone there makes you feel like family and they'll remember you if you go often. If you personally had a problem with your order, speak to Antoine, he will make sure you walk out pleased. The best part about eating here is that I don't leave feeling overwhelmingly heavy and guilty. Have you ever ate fried chicken or fish and felt bogged down afterwards?

After working with Ron as a PT/coach for just a few months, I ran a 10k in 40:49, which is a PR, and a half marathon in 1:30.52, which is right on my PR. These results are huge for me! I used to think that my fastest days were behind me, but I no longer believe that at all. 

When I first contacted Ron, I had been battling a hip/back injury for over a year. This injury caused me to limp (literally) the last four miles of a half marathon. Afterward, I couldn't run more than five miles without significant discomfort, and I had a dull ache in my lower back that was constantly present in my daily life. This went on for months.

I tried all the usual things: Ice, foam roller, stretching, a chiropractor, and diagnosing myself on WebMD. None of this worked. I finally broke down and asked my PCP for a referral to a physical therapist. However, when I went in for my appointment, the physical therapist told me flat-out that there wasn't anything he could do to help me because I was ""already pretty fit."" 

After some Googling, I came across Maximum Velocity Physical Therapy. I was intrigued because Ron describes himself as running/triathlon focused, which is EXACTLY what I wanted. I sent him kind of a crazy, desperate email, and he replied back within hours. My immediate impression was that I'd be in good hands with Ron, and that impression turned out to be 100% correct.

During my first appointment, Ron identified several weaknesses that he thought were contributing to my injury. He prescribed some strengthening exercises and told me that I'd be running pain-free in no time. Frankly, I did not believe him. How could I overcome a year-long injury so quickly? But it turns out he was right. After several weeks of working with Ron, I was able to run long and hard again. And equally amazing--that dull ache in my back finally went away. Thank goodness! 

Several attributes set Ron apart from other physical therapists I have encountered: He is relentlessly positive, has a passion for educating his clients/athletes, and genuinely cares. Plus, he knows how to work with runners and triathletes, which is a rare find. These attributes also happen to make him a great coach. I had a fantastic time working with Ron during my last training cycle, and I'm looking forward to working him in the future. This is not a decision I take lightly; I'm very serious about my training and racing, so it's a big deal to have a coach I trust.

In short: Ron has my highest recommendation. Go see him if you have a stubborn injury, and go see him if you want to get faster!",1,iSblwE7360pc3T10-kwD1Q

You get to select what size you want, the smallest being 1 meat and 1 side. The next would be 2 meats and 2 sides. There were even options to make your own bowl or do an a la carte selection.

I chose the smallest. This was $5 and honestly was pretty satisfying - did not make me too full but I was good. It'd be a great lunch size. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of garlic edamame and you get your choice of rice. Brown rice was a little extra, fyi. 

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection. They have a station next to the drinks that has teriyaki sauce (+ a spicy version if you so desire) so you can add more or add it to your rice like I did!

The garlic edamame was cold. I'm wondering if you can ask for it to be warmed up as I didn't like it as much cold.

I came on a Friday at about 11:45am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time I left around 12:30pm, it seemed like quite the place to be, especially for business lunches/convention attendees. 

I went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.  I did just that with this delicious dish with a nice spiciness that you usually don't get from traditional brunch options.  My meal came with three options of bread as well: raisin, jalapeno, and corn.  The jalapeno was the only one in which I would recommend; the other two were just eh.

My benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.

If you furniture or other household goods call Habitat for Humanity or Opportunity Village who will also pick up from your home. Unfortunately for me, neither had appointments on the day I was available.

That being said I saw online that they can pick up the larger items you want to donate. Great! I fill out the form to schedule a pickup and am contacted via email asking me to call and schedule an appointment. That's just my own personal pet peeve....a business that has email but insists you call. I ignored and proceded to schedule my pick up via email. I was given a date for my appointment but they will not give a time or even a window.

The day of, around 10am I call to see if they could at least give me a window of time when to expect the driver. A girl who before I've even said anything is annoyed that someone dare interrupt her day and for sure sounds like she hates her job picks up. I Gove her my information and ask if there is a time frame for which I can expect someone to stop by. She very curtly tells me I'm #8 on the list and that's all she will say. Me being me I push for more and she finally informs pick ups are made between 8am and 430pm. (remember that next time you complain about the cable/utility companies and their broad windows haha)

So I continue waiting and finally at 208pm I get a call from the driver saying he's on his way. Perfect! Then 45 minutes passes and still I'm waiting. I call the driver and ask how much longer and he says something I can't hear. I advise his voice is hard to hear and he hangs up on me. I call the donation center back trying to get an ETA and advising of what just happened and don't really get any new information. Another 20 minutes or so the donation center calls and tells me the driver was ""confused"" but I'm next on the list. It's 330pm at this point. An entire day wasted.

Shortly after I get a call again from the driver telling me he's on his way. I ask how long and he says he doesn't know, he just passed The M. So you work and live in Vegas but don't know the drive time from The M to the southwest side of town? More importantly you're a delivery driver who has a set schedule of appointments and you haven't planned your routes via GPS or Google Maps?? Another 40 minutes pass and he finally arrives. I show him what needs to be taken and that's when they advise they don't move items from second floor locations nor do they accept televisions. At no point was I given these stipulations. I had help here the day before who could have moved the items to the first floor.


Overall I think at this point Goodwill might be too large of a corporation (yes, technically non profit org) to appreciate that people are willing to support and donate to their organization. And that a little customer service/politeness/GOOD WILL goes a long way. Definitely take the time to research and donate to  other organizations!",4,R99ylbRDzQ5wDB3ZAEN2Xw

//Cheesecake Tart// (14.99)This was recommended to me by by my co-worker and cousin and I was really excited to try this famous cheesecake. Sadly, I was underwhelmed by the taste. It wasn't as cheesy as I hoped and it tasted too light. This particular cheese tart had a thin jelly upper layer that gave the cheese tart an interesting texture (not quite a fan of it). 
//Golden Brulee Cheese Pudding// (3.99) Packaged in its own to-go box with the sugar and caramel sauce. The pudding itself was airy and firm and it was yummy. The caramel sauce was too concentrated and gave a liquor-y taste. I would've prefer the pudding by itself.

The parking is a shared lot and quite small but I got a spot right away on a weekend for brunch. There were a lot of people waiting at the front (all waiting for their coffee to go) so I was seated immediately. Service was good from the moment we walked in. The barista at the front was friendly, as was our server. The wait for our food wasn't long at all, so that was great too. 

The menu is simple and straight forward so it was very easy for me to decide on what I wanted. My partner and I ordered the Platform Waffle and the Sunrise Waffle. They were both yummy but I preferred the Sunrise Waffle more. I think I spent too much time trying to take pictures of the Platform waffle because it got soggy (oops!)  The potato curls were soo addicting! I couldn't stop munching on these. The pricing is average at $15-16 for each waffle. 

Of course, I had to order something to drink at Platform Espresso Bar. I ended up ordering a cappuccino. They were supposed to have two types of espresso to choose from but as they were in between seasons, there was only one in stock, which I was completely fine with. Taste was alright.

In conclusion, it's a cute little shop I would return to, but I wouldn't make it one of my regular stops.",2,Dt_h4Dt0lVblqRxLLV25YQ

Pretty solid and standard place. The food hasn't changed much over 20 years. I've only gone here for brunch and it's pretty hard to mess that up. I always get the 3 egg breakfast. Good amount of home fries that are sprinkled with salt and some red stuff (it's pretty good). Eggs are always over easy. Bacon is a must. This is hit or miss. Can be crispy some days, but most days it's not too crispy. Toast is toast.

We know the waitresses at this place, so they're always pretty nice. I really recommend this place if you're hung over. They really give you a lot of food (carbs), it's pretty cheap, and it's pretty quiet unless you get a rowdy family with 5 jits up in the mix.

In the last 2 years the quality has slowly decreased but today was the worst. The fountain bar is always drenched and there was not even 1 piece of ice.Half of the salad bar had nearly empty containers and they were out of forks. Our salads were on point but when we went for the classic chicken noodle soup the chicken was so hard and tough we couldn't eat it. They pasta bar had mushy dry old pasta. It was approximate 5:30 when we arrived by 7pm it was still the same. The quality is just getting worse and worse. I don't know how their corporation could even be half pleased to allow the current quality of this place. Sad to say I'll have to find a new place,3,di1JBJqc4SlSnckOC6KgCg

Overpriced and extremely Americanized Mexican food.  I was expecting a little bit more out of La Salsa Cantina but then we found the best part of this place, the yard margarita!

They were charging 17.50 for well tequila and 19 for top shelf tequila, which we chose!  You also get to keep the glass here, which was an added plus!  They don't play around with these drinks and they make them strong, taking care of us for the rest of the night!

I was disappointed but nonetheless our server was friendly and attentive to my requests.  The food was good, nothing amazing, and I would consider the price point to be high for the type and quality of food.

I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.

Venue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any ""prime tables"" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.

Food: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. 

The mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.

Cost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.

Bottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.",0,1DsuFRjdW0gDA23Xswzoqg

They do a little bit of false advertising which I called them on and they did not agree with me.  First off their bread is not freshly baked, they do not bake their bread in house, it is baked somewhere else and brought in.. Also their sauce is not exactly home made as they use can tomatoes and spices then add there own unique blend.  They do not know which foods have soy in them exactly, but all there fried food is fried in soy oil. The portions for lunch were very very skimpy only 5 ravioli's for $10.  Excuse me but paying $2.00 for one small ravioli is a little bit ridiculous.  They do not have butter for the bread, nor do they leave the oil and vinegar on the table.  So if you are bread eaters you will have to summon the wait staff lots of times to refill the oil and vinegar dish.  Not a good place for people who have allergies, hardly any gluten free items, no gluten free pasta dishes,  If you happen not to sit in a half booth bring a pillow as the chairs are very very hair and very very skinny.

The cocktail menu is in keeping with the classic feel of the bar. Whiskey, rum, fernet. Inventive takes on classic drinks - but not something that is in everyone's wheel house.

Our motley crew sampled six of the cocktails featured on the menu. Perhaps it's that none of us appreciate bitters like we should, but we were all a bit underwhelmed. The menu of spirits here in stark contrast to what you will find in the restaurant below, and I love every drink I have ordered from that menu.

The place seats about 80, and it appeared there were two servers to a packed lounge. It was some time before anyone came to the table. In fact, our server passed us a couple times before acknowledging we were there. One of us headed up to the bar fully prepared to order cocktails for everyone at the table.

It's not that the food was the best thing that ever happened to me. It's that the food was a solid 8/10. My waiter was an 11/10. The music was a 10/10. The weather the day I visited was a 10/10 (72 in January). Everyone who walked by and worked there smiled and spoke. My overall experience was wonderful. 

My waiter, and I forget his name. He was a very handsome, well built, young thang. He had a great sense of humor. Actually joked with us the whole time and was funny. Not corny, not annoying, legitimate not trying too hard made me laugh funny. You can tell he has a good personality 24/7 and I'm not saying that because he was cute. He even told me I was the slowest eater he ever saw. It's true. Management also walked by and asked if everything was okay. He was genuinely friendly. I loved everyone here.

My friend and I ordered the honey pecan fried chicken, which came with broccoli casserole and mashed potatoes. I subbed my mashed potatoes for sweet potato casserole at no additional cost (Yay!). We also shared spinach dip. The dip was creamy with lots of spinach. We ate every single bite of it. The chips were fresh. Not sure if they cook them in house, but they at least warm them up. Also noteworthy is the price point here is really good. $11/ meal.

The chicken was divine. I was a bit nauseous that day, and still couldn't stop eating. The chicken was cooked perfectly and a bit juicy without being drown in honey. The pecans were not cooked,which I think would've enhanced the flavor. I'm definitely going back and getting the exact same meal.

I ordered the Cinnamon crumble pancakes l very easy order. When the food came out my mom got a fajita omelet with a ton of things she can't eat. We told the waitress about it and she got nasty with us and said ""Well, the manager said this is how it comes"" and did not offer to take it back and fix the very simple omelet my mom asked for. It was made clear that we were SOL. Then my food came the eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns were very good no issues there. My pancakes came out, I ordered the featured Cinnamon crumble pancakes.

I can't believe I actually entertained them but as soon as they finished with their sales pitch without even asking if I was interested the guy pulls out an application and begins asking for my information to get credit started.  I immediately told him I was not ready to get into another credit card payment and I am not interested.  He continued trying to make me feel guilty about my family's health and we shouldn't put a price on it....blah, blah, blah.  The seller then says let me see a correspondence or ID to see if you qualify, this is when he completely insulted my intelligence.  He looks at the mail and pretends to plug something into his phone and then says, ""yes you qualify for financing and you only pay $40 a month""  I asked how in the world would you know that, he proceeds to point to some numbers above my name on this letter ...COME ON ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! He knew how I was not the least bit interested but continued to pressure me  to the point that I felt this was too overwhelming for me and maybe they can leave me alone if I sign this sh*t. My husband was not around to help me out of this so I said yes and asked if I'm not satisfied with product can I return and they said yes, don't worry, and trust us. I told them I need to speak with my husband first then I will call him the next day to confirm.
I was so uneasy with this whole transaction that I could not sleep, had knots in my stomach and just didn't feel RIGHT.  Sure enough the next day I researched this company and saw so many negative reviews, and at this point I didn't care how great the products worked (and by the way amazon sells for a fraction of the cost). Someone online stated that the only way she got a refund was by cancelling your transactions by the first days of the sale.
I called the seller and of course his phone does not receive incoming calls.  So emailed him stating I will be cancelling my order today!  He immediately calls me and I tell him I want to cancel and furthermore I told him not submit my paperwork until I called him to confirm after I discuss with my husband , he responds, "" no don't worry we already processed your paperwork. He again reassured me that if I need a return it will be given to me, trust him and quickly rushes off the phone...HA!  
At this point I am being stringed along and feeling frustrated and taken advantage of.  I immediately called the company directly and questioned their return policy.  The rep stated that they there are NO RETURNS ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  You are only able to cancel within the first 3 day of transactions.  After those 3 days pass you are bind by contract to make payments even if you are not satisfied with product.
Follow these directions for returns:  please do so by before the first 3 business days of signing the transactions
1. Call the company (877) 494-2289, cancel and ask for a cancellation number
2. Fill the back of the sales transaction and print the cancellation # on the front and back of form
3. Fax to (708) 562-0320
4.  Call to verify they received fax
The customer service people are courteous and are not pushy at all!  When I called to verify they received my fax they said yes and it was sent to the distributor.  I will check in 5 days.
PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES THE TROUBLE and to don't fall for this! They are slick and also try to tell if you cancel the salesperson gets a points on license and could lose their license. Well maybe they need to stop being pushy and if someone says not interested keep it moving and leave them alone.  SORRY BUT NOT SORRY to the sales person.

We, my friend M, my (K) friend and I went there for dinner at 6:30 ish, on a Saturday night July 30, 2016, were greeted by her. It was K's birthday. She oyr server, was very open and accommodating, saying to the ladies lets start with drinks, when they were not sure, offered coffee, water etc, my wife said we were looking for Bellinis.  Amy, I found out, was her name, suggested several, so the choice was Peach instead of strawberry. Yum. I had the coke as designated driver.  Next was food. The list was great but I went for safe choice on food, just a regular burger? Wrong, it not regular, its big. It can be made with various choices. My friend took the fried egg as a topping, yes.  I had the Sauteed mushrooms as well.  Amy was good, asking questions like Yolk side up or down, etc, on my Burger I got multi grain bun.  I had wanted whole wheat but loved this choice.  M, ordered Chicken Quesadilla as a starter but woah, its huge, its a meal. Also it has lots and lots of Chicken in it. She has had it at some known restaurants, ie the One starting with D (Franchise chain, various locations) and a sports bar starting with S (named after sea fish) and neither of those have even 1/3 the amount of chicken in it,  Names of competitors were left out. It serves no reason to name them.  Dixon's out did everyone.  My Burger was better than that of Five Guys, Gal and Fries place.  I am thinking if this is their regular style of menu, I will be eating here more often.   Our total was under $70.00. 
Amy our server checked on us several times, refilling the drinks, Coke and coffee, offering Mayonnaise for fries for my friend.  She said it was her second shift so I was nervous on bill, you know  having to ask about corrections, no, I did not need it. When members of my party wanted to split bill, I refused, sent them to VLT's where they made money, Amy took it as a sign to give me the bill quickly, paid for it, so the others would not see bill.  Ralph, Wheres the Bill? Oops it got soaked then destroyed, but its paid so you cannot share bill, ha ha. Guys This is how its done.  Amy was so professional, so sweet and not using her looks to sell food. She told us about the different foods, how some of them tasted, how big they were. 
About us: I am a very cautious eater, always checking ingredients etc for dietary and medical reasons, M is a person whom loves to try foods, but nervous about prep, K is a seasoned restaurant food eater.

The tv at table had UFC on screen, so it was a topic of sorts, we did not like the matches but that's opinion. You could put menu in front of screen to block show.  I felt very good about tonight's dining experience.  I left full (stomach) from just the burger and fries, this was unusual. I had no space for the desert, Apple Pie, which is like a slab in size. This is unusual.",1,EnOJ0nZWQKGDiUGU8usOhg

However the guys in the store answering phones are terrible. They interrupt, mumble, are short with you and are not friendly at all. I've dealt with it because they're the only people that deliver late, but after last night I'm never ordering there again.

We got home after a show at midnight and wanted food before bed so we ordered from the only place open: hungry howies. Ordering took several minutes because the guy kept interrupting me and mumbling and I had to ask him to repeat himself every single sentence, which was aggravating. He told me the pizza would be there in 45 minutes to an hour, which was fine. We sat up waiting, my boyfriend fell asleep and after an hour and a half I was so hungry I just made something else and was getting ready to get into bed when FINALLY, the guy shows up.

PcfFrGL6NgS0gqneNE8R0A,2,2016-11-16 20:34:14,3,FPz4MTPKLyQirOUmLtoNZg,"Came here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a party of 7, ended up being a total disappointment.

Strike 1: Lack of communication between staff. When we walked to the front door, a staff member politely opened the door for us. However, as we walked by him to enter into the restaurant, he said that no tables were currently available. He was just in the process of telling us the wait time, when one of the other staff members stated that we could be seated right away. At least check the tables before you turn customers away.

Strike 2: Water did not arrive at the table until after 20 minutes of being seated. PLUS, the ""Sweet"" Tea was NOT sweet at all. Water and Sweet Tea were requested, but we were left waiting and thirsty. The place was not packed with customers, and water/sweet tea should not take long to bring to the table.

Strike 3: My boyfriend, of all people, did not receive his entree until the rest of the table had just about finished their meals! He ordered the Seafood Delight, which is a combination of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops in marinara sauce over linguine for $19.95. I understand that it is a large dish and has a lot of components to it, but if it's not almost ready, don't bring out the rest of the table's meals yet, keep the other dishes heated on warmers in the kitchen. The waitress said it would be about 4 more minutes. It took a lot longer than 4 minutes. It did not take the rest of the table only 4 minutes to finish their meals. We were not speed-eating. We were chatting and enjoying our meals at a decent pace. PLUS, the waitress brought extra bread to the table when we still had plenty of bread, and there was clearly no more space for bread, except in front of my boyfriend, where his actual entree belonged. We were utterly confused. None of us had requested more bread. It was as if the waitress thought it would make things better if she brought more bread instead of the entree. We ended up having to wait on my boyfriend.

In terms of the other food, the Fried Calamari ($9.95) was chewy and the skin covering was pale and unappealing. It did not have the nice crisp to it that I was expecting. The Del Boscaiola (Parmesan cream sauce with prosciutto and peas for $11.25) was delicious. I chose Cappellini noodles. I enjoyed the sauce. There were far too many peas, but I didn't mind. The Seafood Delight should be shared. In terms of portion, it is too much for one person. I do like the shrimp and scallop. However, the presentation is sloppy.

Strike 4: I asked if they did anything special for birthdays. The waitress said the staff would sing ""Happy Birthday"" and give us a slice of Tiramisu. Fantastic. Except the staff failed to communicate again. It was supposed to be a surprise for my boyfriend. However, one staff member started approaching us and happily singing ""Happy Birthday."" Then, he stopped abruptly when he realized that nobody else was following suit. So much for a surprise. The rest of the staff then awkwardly tried to restart the singing and brought out the Tiramisu. Of course, the Tiramisu didn't even have a candle on it. Great. Well, at least the Tiramisu tasted great.",4,URWpOVK9fAmpQvntMa9LOQ

LET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. 
I'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. 

Recommendations: 

Popcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.

Bulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. 

Topoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in.",2,VQenIJ5AzqURtDSUYv76rg

It is confusing. Either you order pizza from the almost non existent server, or you walk to the hot table and wait forever for food. So, essentially no one eats at the same time. 

Pizza:  I love wood oven pizza. I ordered the margarita which was described as tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil. When I got it I was shocked there was dried basil on it. Not fresh. Weird. 

If you want good pizza, go to Joia. This pizza wasn't good at all.

They got the whole project done in 1 day with 2 1/2 guys (Bill helped in the am). We had two ceiling fans (one in each living space), 4 can lights in each living space, and 8 can lights put into our kitchen. The living spaces have vaulted ceilings as well, so it was a big job. 

This business is wonderful and we plan on using them in the future when we get to renovating our bathroom. I would highly recommend asking for the same electricians, Michael and Robert but have no doubt their other employees are just as qualified!",0,sZ4gTEd7g49rrw0OQ_WJFA

Moral of the story is this place is REALLY unorganized. they are 100% scammers. I would never do business with this place EVER AGAIN! and for all the fuckery they put me thru they also made me late on my paying my Buick vehicle payment due to them letting me just drive off the lot with no final paperwork (financial managers fault) and not keeping in contact with my for OVER 2 WEEKS!.

  My husband ordered the Rigatoni Marinara Turkey Meatballs.  The presentation of this dish was not as appealing as the DK Pasta.  The Marinara was slightly lacking in seasoning.  There was a generous portion of meatballs and overall the dish was good.  Great customer service.

Originally lured in by the $5 t-shirt vehicle wrap on a van parked near my home, we called in and said, ""saw the sign,"" not in an Ace of Base voice, ""what can you do with a 72 hour lead time?""

Pretty much anything... cool.

So, we sent over an extremely pixilated image of what we wanted, which they were able to help find a version that was actually workable and off to the races we went!

After several phone calls with us changing our mind (maybe 'several' is an understatement) we had proceeded to build what many would've seen as the worlds most expensive custom company picnic t-shirt. For us, approximately $13 per shirt seemed like a steal.

So, 72 hours later, we had spiffy new t-shirts, and while we looked stylish at the picnic, we didn't win any of the events. So, if you're looking for a cool shirt for a low price... look here. If you're looking for a winning lottery ticket to pop out of your shirt pocked, or you just need some general luck-- keep walking. Or pick up one of the pre-printed shirts with a funny saying that they have in stock, and at least you'll have laughed today.

We literally had the place to ourselves and were able to order off the lunch menu. The spicy items are marked accordingly and on the other side of the menu were Thai inspired dishes.

From her vantage point she could see some people coming in for take out. The lunch prices are very reasonable. With your choice of entree you get a choice of soup or eggroll, white, fried, or brown rice as your side. With your check you get a store bought fortune cookie.

She had the General Tso's chicken with rice and eggroll. I had the chicken and shrimp entree mixed with vegetables. Needless to say service was fast and the food very tasty. My friend told me that her General Tso's was not overly spicy. I enjoyed my dish as well. I was please with the portion size as I normally do not finish the rice when I order. Here it was just enough.

The eggrolls came with both the duck and hot sauce almost combined but you could tell the difference just by looking at it.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs and did ask if we wanted to split the check. I refused but was grateful she had asked.

This is a nice option when dining on Mt. Washington since Shiloh St has a lot of eateries as well as the Grandview bakery and love Pittsburgh shop. Street or lot metered parking is available. If you heading up that way avoid Sycamore St since part of that road is closed. Shiloh is a one way St so it is best to head over to Grandview Ave and proceed down from there.

7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw,0,2011-01-20,0,36LRjPqfA9WvXEFvIsHlhA,"Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot. 

All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true

- This place is not close to the strip.
- The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour +
- The restaurant is smallish.

However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?

I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.

Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.

I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.

If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.

All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.

You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.

But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. 

I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.

Things I LOVE from Sushimon

Nigiri:
- Hamachi (Yellowtail)
- Salmon
- Super White Tuna
- Unagi

Other offerings:
- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)
- Salmon Collar
-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)
-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)
-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)

Dessert(AYCE)
-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)
-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream
- Tempura Ice cream

Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more ""glamorous"" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. 

In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list.",2,wWhllrw0Y_Dl5rHEUDUdww

For those of you unfamiliar with the word, truie means sow in French so the name refers to a fat female pig.  The menu is true to its name so there are plenty of pork-inspired dishes here.

The restaurant looks very simple and unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though it feels elegant and intimate.  It is also quite large inside so there is plenty of seating to be had.  They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.

While there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.

Dessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.

The service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.

Prices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.  The experience as a whole was just okay.  Nothing awful but nothing excellent either.",2,UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of ""hipster"" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their ""square"" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting. Maybe it's not her job to help but it seemed super weird not to even comment on the situation or acknowledge her co-worker. Maybe she was a robot.",0,ZMP8fRHf-Br2wgAoqQhVUQ

j-urGIzi2FKGopeY57w0cg,0,2013-10-29,1,ki0jr4yDCmW5NFYKRMdxvA,"I love Your Helping Hands! I enjoyed their services so much, I wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a ""Top Pick"" of Las Vegas. Here it is below--

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say ""Sorry guys, not happening.""

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her ""girls"". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over.",4,n2CFEt4RJXcWb-7MCbdzmA

1. The taps are shit and immediately nullified our main reason for coming. You get charged for the amount of time you pull them, no matter how much beer actually comes out, and it's about 90% foam. One of the taps was actually empty and charged us around $15 when all it did was sputter. We notified a server who gave us a new card, but it was for $14 instead of checking how much we were actually charged for the error. They will say people don't know how to pour, but that's not true. Keg parties were my unofficial major in college. Everyone using the self-serve was laughing about how much of a joke it was.

2. The servers were not attentive. When we arrived, it was ""Please Seat Yourself"" and not busy at all. We went straight to the beer wall and waited several minutes before someone got us set up. Then we walked around to figure out where to sit. First we tried the patio and then moved inside. It was probably 15 or more minutes before a waitress made eye contact with us and came over. Most of the time, they are standing around talking to each other under the giant tree or by the soda machine. Food didn't take very long to arrive. We were waiting forever between times where we'd see our server, so I asked for our bill and some waters. She came back with just the bill.

3. Food was ok but nothing to rave about. I had a sampler, and my wife had the satay chicken skewers. The sampler needs a side of ranch to go with the buffalo wings.

4. We were trying to watch the Rams vs. Falcons game, but 2 douchey millennials came up on stage to sing and play their guitars during the game. It wasn't just during commercials or timeouts...it was during the game. We got the hell out of there.",0,sCr9Q4ORBvejiy4HtoQR-Q

Generally speaking, I like what's known as the ""white food."" At Thai Original BBQ I'm a big fan of their lunch specials. You get a great little side salad, then your main course for less than $9, not a bad deal.

So my staple item at this location is good ol' #1, the BBQ Chicken with Fried Rice. 90% of the time the chicken is moist, the skin has great flavor, and it's cooked to perfection. Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side. Periodically I'll go off the deep end and get the Pad Thai, which is decent, but I'm quickly reminded that nothing beats the BBQ chicken.

Thursday night for some reason is normally one of the busier nights.  We ended up sitting in the bar.  Normally we avoid the bar because we have kids, and there is a live band or music there. However it just seemed like a good place to sit you I think we were really missing with a fireplace. It would have been great fire going in there to really warm you up as playschool it cools down pretty fast once somebody open the front door. Wish list aside, we ordered our drinks kids got their hot chocolate and lemonade.

No I have not been reviewing too much as I have been counting my calories. However I find it if I make the right choices at Red Hawk I can still say well within my calorie budget. I ended up ordering a new sandwich off their menu called the chipotle chicken crunch. It's got these really thin onion rings with bacon cheese on top of a grilled Chicken sandwich and I believe there are jalapenos on there too. I did the math and calculated it out the whole sandwich runs about the same as a Big Mac. I deleted the fries and got a house salad on the side.  As far as comfort food goes if you are starving yourself during the week eating nothing but rabbit food this sandwich really hit the spot. I also ordered fish and chips for my son. He is 7 but obviously does not want to eat the whole adult portion so the kitchen is really cool and they will take whatever adult portion you find and turn it into a kids portion. So he's fish and chips came with to rather large fish sticks or fillets or whatever you call them. And of course fries and they managed to scrounge up some broccoli and green beans for him too. He was excited. What I did find out is that almost everything in this restaurant is made from scratch the balsamic vinaigrette for my salad scratch. There were salad dressings were also from scratch. French fries are fresh cut, and nothing tastes like its been sitting in a freezer for 3 months. I think they've really stepped up their game up and every employee in there is invested in seeing the place do better",0,09jpZrKD_j0SG9WPBDSJQg

The pasta was cooked very well, but it lacked what some would describe as passion and love for the food itself.  My seafood fettuccine had seafood in it, but it just didn't have the seafood flavour.  Perhaps the seafood was from frozen, or the cream sauce didn't have any seafood juices in it.

Police were there as well, directing pedestrians and traffic for safety (liked that).  This place is a huge, 100 acre or so family farm, with a gift shop, bakery, restaurant, snack stands, and concession stands.  There are many attractions for kids, since the focus is on them here.

Showed up to the same cozy environment I remember, but WOW have they improved the menu and the food! Their menu is full of endless customizations for burgers and sandwiches, with plenty of unique, yet solid appetizer and entree options. 

I had their salmon with veggies and rice, my boyfriend had the lamb burger, and we split an order of the Rosemary fries.

The table next to us got their food much quicker than us, even though we ordered first, and we received our fries at the same time as our meal which was a little disappointing.

But once we tasted the feast set before us, service wasn't a thought in our minds. The salmon was impressive for a little pub like this. Tender and flavorful, and paired wonderfully with the perfectly cooked veggies. His lamb burger was, in his words, a solid burger that makes him want to go back to try a regular hamburger. 

My favorite part of the meal, though, were the rosemary fries with parmesan dipping sauce. Perfectly crispy on the outside, with a melt-in-your-mouth inside. Not greasy! The rosemary combined with the parmesan was out of this world.

Service wasn't excellent, but due to the quiet (for a pub) ambiance, and of course great food, I will definitely be returning!",1,YI4tuzuHjI7SegKskkxReg

The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. 

   After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger. 

   Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and ""Shriek."" If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax. 

    Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness. 

   It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York. 

  Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.

  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the ""People Love Us on Yelp""  sticker.",13,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w

My wife ordered the flight of five different beer selections, while I ordered the Bell road IPA.  I enjoyed my IPA, and the aroma was very pleasant; while the flavor and drinkability was average.  I tried each of the flights with my wife and noticed the following:  The Sours were very sour (good job!), the hefeweizen had the typical cloudy banana aroma and flavor, the Gose and amber also had all the characteristics of their respective types.

I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered a burger.  My meal was subpar and the fish was not cooked completely and heavily battered.  This was disappointing.  My wife said her burger was OK and cooked a little darker than the medium she requested.  In short, the food leaves a lot to be desired.

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW.",16,1h6YEViaFaRvtOC96YSqgw

d0z2wUeAuqB5eSpMQ4fC1w,0,2015-11-23 14:43:27,2,eFWukMrrsaPfiuFHLT6PBA,"I've been using this dealership for 2 years now. First with my used car for oil changes; then I bought a new car from them and have been using them for regular maintenance and the warranty repairs. There are several reasons why I feel the service for Toyotas should be outsourced:

1. This dealership does not want you to come back for service, they have no incentive to provide quality service. This is reflected in the failure to repair items the first time and the employee callus response when you tell them the vehicle has been there for this simple repair previously. There is absolutely no accountability and they just don't care.

2. Expect to wait 4+ hours for something simple like an oil change or just changing out a light bulb. It doesn't matter if you're paying cash, have a financed maintenance plan or are in for a warranty repair. This is a problem they could fix by having longer hours during the weekend when it is most busy; but instead they close at 5 on Saturday and don't open at all on Sunday. If you have a problem outside those hours, there is no one to help you. The sales department manager won't even answer his phone or call you back. The roadside assistance is a joke. If you make it through the myriad of phone prompts, expect to have all kinds of problems getting someone to you.

3. They won't do all services and their recommended Vendor for windshield repair/replacement installed my windshield twice where I could push the glass out afterward. Took 3 separate visits to get the glass actually touching the glue. -- I had a 8 inch crack, got it replaced, had to get up charged for the Toyota glass, didnt touch the glass at all, but could feel the wind coming through it on the freeway. Took two more visits before the tech just pushed on the glass and said ""there's the problem"" displaying the obvious gap. Smh.

4. Once they have your vehicle in service they have no incentive to get it back to you. So you may go days without a car with no notice. -- They  do have a courtesy shuttle when they are open; but you may wait 3+ hours after it is scheduled to pick you up. 

5. They can't get Toyota parts same day even if you've made an appointment in advance and they know the issue. It's usually 3 days to a week and then you get to come back when the parts arrive and start the process all over again. One time, they told me they would call me when the part arrived, a month later I called them and found out it had arrived they held it and then they returned it. So I had to wait again for them to reorder the part. Another time I had to leave my car there while they could troubleshoot with corporate, which is only weekdays. So that was another day without my car, and more rides.

Normally I'm very understanding of a busy day at the dealership and I was excited to have a standard new vehicle that would be easy to repair.  -- but this service department destroys the reliable and easy to work on reputation of Toyota by making regular maintenance a nightmare.

 This time its just the side mirror interior part that broke and 2nd time in on the same brake light replaced. This will be my last visit here. I just don't have the time for this nonsense. 

I remember the 90's well, when Jiffy Lube had all the parts and could do my service, replace my windshield wipers and break lights in under an hour. I don't know what happened to the auto repair industry or where I will take my Toyota now. I am seriously considering trading it in for a Honda just so I can take it anywhere for service.",14,cVz8ZPsnXCzb_ovHv13LBA

First, it didn't start until 15 minutes after my appointment time. Had it run 15 minutes longer, I wouldn't have cared, but it only lasted 75 minutes. By 10 p.m. (my massage was scheduled for 4:30 p.m.), I had a huge red burn, including at least three blisters, on my torso because a stone was too hot. While I was told to let the massage therapist know if it was too hot, when I did say something, apparently it was too late. I wouldn't be so upset, but before the stone was placed on my torso, the massage therapist said, ""This one might be a little hot."" If she, a trained massage therapist thought the stone might be too hot, I can't understand why it was placed on me. (This was my first (and likely last) hot stone massage, and the therapist was aware of this before the massage began.)  When I woke up this morning, which was 15 hours after the massage, I noticed that I also have a burn on my back.  I like to see local businesses succeed, but I definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone.

UPDATE:  I just spoke with Aaron, the owner, who was incredibly apologetic and refunded my money.  He also offered me a free massage. I don't doubt that this most likely is a good place to go for a massage (very clean, and the folks that work there seem to be really nice and easy going), but because of my own personal experience, I won't recommend it.",0,BfspuXDto_IF_ythhTPnEQ

rzcCrNNqpPYhMSOVfpYezw,0,2012-10-12 01:22:49,3,xBYMiVPQAg7An3fqKmGtUg,"Dentonia is a challenging course only because it is partly a hiking trip. I was lugging around my pull cart UP and DOWN and UP and DOWN.... for every single hole... 

They do NOT have cart rentals available, which is shocking - considering at how slopy this course was. The slopes are also what makes this par 3 course difficult. Your short game will really mess you up, or maybe it's just me. 

I went in early October, and there were so many leaves on the green, putting was almost impossible. I brushed the leaves away from my putting line, and WHOOSH the wind will blow more over. (repeat for all 18 holes) 

There is a vendor selling drinks on a golf cart that comes around once in awhile, I think they should hire someone to maintain the greens instead. 

There were a few holes that we needed to tee off on this beaten up mat. I agree with everyone else - they need to have those replaced. 

I don't think it's worth it to pay $27.00 per person to play on a poorly maintained course. I'm guessing that's the price they can charge for being 'in the city' and right beside Victoria Park TTC Station. 

There are much better/well maintained golf courses outside the GTA that charge at a cheaper price. So, for those who own a vehicle, you're better off elsewhere!",1,m7z-tX6XDZ27xGhGjnI21w

Well, it's true they have lots of gourmet items, but it's pretty much limited to wine and olive oil with some cheese and already prepared foodstuffs in between.  The layout of the store was extremely frustrating.  Despite the store being large enough to theoretically hold 30 customers quite adequately, the layout created all sorts of traffic jams and line convergences.  It was really annoying to say the least.  We didn't buy anything because of what looked like a mile long line.

I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! 

Check in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. 

The rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. 

This is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. 

Check-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! 

Overall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from.

It was my first Bobby Flay experience and so I was looking forward to it.  I had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and I didn't know how Tex Mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.  

The restaurant's atmosphere is great.  It's bright and welcoming.  This place is busy so definitely make reservations.  

We showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  They were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  I was impressed with how they handled it.  I worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.

After we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  Everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  The rock shrimp tamale was oh so good!  I am not a Rib Eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  I also had the duck pancake.  I would have eaten those all night.  I would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  It was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!) 

The chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  People it's NOT Bobby Flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  Give credit where credit is deserved!  A lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! The presentations were beautiful as well.

And I can't forget the backwaits.  Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).

The prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  Other than the quality being top notch you are in Caesars eating at Bobby Flay.  If you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to Denny's.  I think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.

This was a great meal. I would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  I love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as I did!",1,d7mGRuYwaXtt8UgYFyfW-A

It's a creative menu with extra touches you don't get in any standard Chinese dim sum selection. Wagyu beef, chunks of lobster, truffles, etc. 


Shredded Peking Duck and enoki mushrooms in a thick soup flavored with finely shredded conpoy.

Steamed lobster dumpling stuffed with shrimp mousse & finely diced vegetable flavored with garlic.

Steamed scallop, shredded dried conpoy & white fungus in dumpling. 

Steamed dumplings of Waygu beef accompanied with thinly sliced Waygu beef, in chili oil.

Deep-fried roll of mixed vegetable & assorted mushrooms.

Deep-fried taro root paste dumpling filled with shredded chicken.

Truffle & lobster escalopes on crispy egg noodles flavored with truffle scented oil.

Chinese dessert - this was a dan tat and a steamed red bean stuffed rice skin ball type of item.

Obviously you don't go to a fancy dancy Chinese restaurant and order the same-old same-old as all dim sum places when you can have something besides that. There is a tea menu as well but you can order more standard teas as well for less. I ordered Tiguanyin (not part of the tea menu), it was alright but definitely not a tiguanyin I would buy by itself. We enjoyed every item on our tasting menu and actually left quite full. They speak Chinese and English perfectly fine, and it's easy to converse in both together.

The resort is condo style and we had basically a 2 bedroom apartment. It was off the strip but Lyft is so cheap to travel around the price difference is worth it. They also have free shuttles. Having a full kitchen and living room is nice also. There was some construction noise in the morning. But it wasnt coming from the resort.

El Hefe - You can instantly smell the jalapeño coming off the head, which is a very light one that dissipates quickly, so enjoy it while it lasts.  The beer starts like a hefeweizen and leaves a slight jalapeño heat on the back of your tongue to finish that disappears just as soon as your tongue picks it up.  This is a great beer if you like hefs and enjoy spicy things (I do).

Ba-Dunkle - Not very aromatic at all, ditto for head (where most the aroma comes from). It is a smooth, wheaty beer though. Not anything great, but a solid beer. It was my least favorite of the four.

Chocolate Victory - The head was nice and thick, and held up longer than the other four pours. This beer has a definite ""chocolate"" look (color) with toasty notes coming off the head. The nice toasty malt taste is balanced with just the right amount of hop bitterness. It had a creamy but smooth mouth feel. This was my favorite of the four.

Black Eye P.A. - Had some fruity hop notes off the head which contrasts nicely against  the dark color (you don't expect a beer that dark to smell that fruity). Both thick and creamy, it is just bitter enough to balance all that malt and not overly hoppy. I'm must say I'm not a fan of unimaginative IPAs, but I do love black IPAs because they have more character, and this is one has to be one of the best I've had.

They do sausages out front (different company) if you get hungry.  There is plenty of bar seating and table seating as well.  I know most people wanna walk up and down Fremont making noise, drinking macro-brews, and acting a fool.  I like sitting down at the end of Fremont, sipping my craft brew, relaxing to some good music and company.

I'll definitely be back for more (and I'm taking a growler of that Chocolate Victory home).",5,bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g

The food was good, but nothing incredibly memorable. The asiago artichoke and crab dip appetizer was very tasty, but our burgers were nothing special.  I ordered their house beer, which had a nice flavor to it and went well with the food.

The restaurant itself has a nice brewhouse/restaurant atmosphere to it.  Servers were quite nice, and the service was prompt and efficient.  Personal tip: the outside patio is great during the daytime to watch the activity of downtown Charlotte, but after it gets dark, the people walking around get a lot sketchier.

I ADORE having a food store this large in selection (can foods) within a few blocks of my house. I LOVE that they have a relatively good selection of meats, breads, canned goods. I LOVE that they are open when the market is not (because i can only get to the market on fridays and weekends- work schedule). 

I hate the costumer service i have gotten there EVERY single time. Especially in the Deli- prepare to wait a LONG time. I HATE that they have prices that are MUCH HIGHER THEN the west side market, the Athens Stores right around the bend and MUCH higher then anywhere else in the city. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HOW CRUMMY, and OLD, and CRAPPY their produce is. its A given that everything you buy will go bad VERY soon- much sooner then it should. Even within few days- and that is hard for someone who LOVES to cook Fresh.  They hold produce and fruit, on the shelf passed when most stores would not.  i have been so upset by the veggies and fruits that i have bought there, i actually started driving 20 mins down 90 to get to the Giant Eagle where EVERYTHING is cheaper, and FRESH IS FRESH.

No, I had not received any sort of notification or email about the cancellation.

Customer service tried to deceive me with lame excuses of why I didn't receive it yet till they ran out of excuses and admitted that they had run out of stock. I'm flabbergasted. No where during the sales process was I informed that the purchase was contingent on there being enough stock to fulfill the order. If I had known that, I would never have purchased the TV from Costco to begin with; Instead I would have gone with Amazon but now the deal theres is gone. Alas, Now I'm screwed. I don't have a TV, and the deals that were available over that weekend are no longer available.
I still see the charge on my credit card statement and until this moment I didn't receive a refund for what I paid.

I opted for a glass of Pinot and did the pasta combo -- spaghetti, ravioli, sausage and meatballs. Sauce was actually good with lots of flavor. I was expecting a bland and watery sauce, but it held up. Awesome prices for the amount of food you get.

Their affordable prefixed menu stands out from the crowd. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the wait staff is knowledgable and kind. Where it fell flat for my party were the items on the menu and the food that came out. We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled.",1,rSlsywnkymvlvggoGDCx3g

Overall a disappointing experience. This place earns a 2 1/2 stars in my book, but I am giving them 2 stars based on the rating scale. 

We had reservations at 8P since that was the earliest they could accommodate our party of 6 on a Saturday night. (we made reservations 2 days out) We arrived at 7:45P and were advised to return at 8P as our table was not available yet. Not a problem, interesting that they did not invite us to wait in the bar area. However, the bar seemed crowded with diners as well. We returned at 8P and were seated within 5 minutes. Although we placed our orders within 10 minutes of being seated, our dinners were not served until 9:15 P. 

First the positive stuff......dinners are served with a house salad and two sides. The BBQ Bourbon Rib Eye steak was excellent. Cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. Prime Rib was served medium rare as requested. Mashed potatoes were made from real potatoes and not the instant stuff. 

Now for the negative.....Our waiter spent the better part of the evening attending to another table across way so it was near impossible to get his attention. Luckily, the assistant waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses filled and handle any requests that we had. I ordered the lobster since it was recommended in several reviews. Unfortunately, I thought it was on the tough side. (maybe it was overcooked?!?) In addition, it was barely lukewarm when served. Since it had taken so long for our dinner to arrive, I was afraid if I sent it back, I may never get anything to eat. In my past experience, the waiter usually removes the lobster tail from the shell ~ not in this case. Once our dinner was served, I don't recall seeing our waiter until dessert time. I tasted a piece of my friend's prime rib. Although it was served medium rare as requested, the meat was barely lukewarm at best and not that tender. The meat had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper. 

Prices are reasonable, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. The general consensus of our group is that we would not recommend this place nor would we be returning for a second visit.",1,_5jHtjmDb6Ktdd19xm9hNQ

Which we made sure the server and restaurant knew about, nothing above and beyond or even ""special"" was done or offered.  (Except a little confetti on the table)

Things started with being handed a huge wine list on a tablet with no guidance - then no personal assist from the sommelier, just the server asking them a brief question for us.  

Excessively seasoned (fire hot), appetizer.  Almost inedible for a few of us at the table.  I suspect the use of a complementary voucher to be the culprit for that. 

Then being served the wrong steaks and having to switch them ourselves at the table.   Once the steaks were settled, they seemed very well prepared and were enjoyed. 

Onward to addressing one of the party members by the wrong gender.  Apologizing of course, but still uncomfortable. 

Another of our party ordered the pan seared tuna - it was the worst cut of tuna possible.  Stringy, difficult to bite and without being given a steak knife it was almost impossible to cut. (The meal was not sent back because of the occasion and not wanting to make a fuss)

We ended our meal with burnt coffee and what turned out to be delicious desserts. 

The price, the occasion and the fact we went for dinner, not lunch, added up to the assumption that this would be a wonderful evening.  It turned out mostly mediocre.  I honestly have had a better time and better food, for a more reasonable price at local/neighborhood bars/resturaunts.  Do not fall for the hype. Try a small local fine dining restaurant.

*sigh*

I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.  
But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.

Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993)
10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.

The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004)
So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, ""regrettably"" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...

By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988)
At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with ""that guy""... who told us to talk to ""this guy""... who said to KT, ""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club"".  Wow, really?

Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996)
During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.

Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988)
So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.

Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO.

Everything they serve comes with a glistening sheen of butter, which makes everything delicious and rich, and makes for a bit of heartburn later. Not the worst thing ever.

They make an extremely good steak, perfectly cooked. Their ingredients are excellent. Admittedly I tend to be there just about closing time, but I always get the impression that they can't decide if they are a fine dining establishment or a sports bar where the waitstaff would rather go home than deal with me. 

Their steak salad with home fries and grilled onions means the potatoes, onions and sliced steak are on top of the salad. With butter. So all these delicious components don't quite work as a protein on a salad. I know Pittsburgh is famous for potatoes on sandwiches, but it's just an odd layer to work though.

Their steak sandwich and open faced steak sandwich are exactly what it says: a steak sitting on top of a slice of bread. Absolutely delicious, but not something I would pick up with my hands and eat.

I was told to have a seat in the waiting area which I did. The area was comfy with big comfy chairs. Within minutes (maybe 5) I was called into the room. 

The lady who serviced me was friendly, very chatty, and asked lots of questions about my expectations with the service. Before doing anything she confirmed exactly what she was going to do and asked me if that was ok. I thought that was amazing. I can't even count the number of times I got for a clean up and walk out with a completely new look (which I didn't ask for). 

I felt this place to be a little small but welcoming in it's appearance. I found the price to be really expensive. With tip it cost me double to get my face down. I guess that is the price you have to pay sometimes for convince! I was really shocked but had no choice I was stuck for time but next time I will shop around my work a little better strictly because of that.",3,oSL39s__owii0Me8u-OS9g

The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.

You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!

We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.

It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.

It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again! 

We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being ""busy"" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...). 

The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!

We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect. 

Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining.",1,KAsmY6WCUWRYQXE_50AkQA

(Actually, I'd move or shoot myself, but let's just pretend.) We stopped by during their Sunday brunch madness, found ourselves staring down an hour wait, and opted for food to-go on our way to the desert.
The staff at DW is impressively competent and friendly. They're essentially wrangling a herd of ravenous socialites with the attention spans and attention demands of toddlers, and they do so admirably.
Not surprisingly, we ordered Jerk Chicken & Waffles as well as the Jerk Pork Hash. Both meats were nicely cooked and the portions were perfect. If you're still reading, you're no doubt wondering why this isn't a four-star review. Two reasons:
1. Their jerk seasoning is much too timid. You get the allspice, some herbs, and citrus (there's even some additional orange rind on the waffles), but the habanero heat is a no show. It doesn't move far enough beyond regular chicken & waffles.
2. I am not a weirdo who carries condiments in my man-purse, but I'm officially designating DW as a B.Y.O.Syrup establishment. It's a sad moment when you find yourself wishing you could un-pour the sticky sweetness you just splashed all over your waffles and chicken (for the record, you cannot). You know that irrevocable moment when you dump way too much brandy or Grand Marnier into your recipe and convert the whole dish into a boozy mess? We've all done it, and we'll probably do it again. With luck, DW only did it on the day we visited. The syrup was odd, overbearing, and unfortunate. You have been warned.",0,2zhTsvYOEPQaQP9w53zkvA

Well, they were right.  Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas. This review really teeters around 4.5 stars...

We started off with the Chicken Chili Stir fry and Lamb Seekh Kabob. Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). 

Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!

I also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)

The chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!

The husband is not a fan of eating Indian food in restaurants since it's never up to our standards; however, he said we would be back to Origin India very soon! Kudos to Chef Kuldeep Singh!",0,Ta9LFVuDqpEx3NzFjNpvRw

Executive chef and owner Jose Leyva is a master at creating amazing flavors in his kitchen.  Last night was our third dining experience at Blue Adobe SFG over the past few weeks and there are still menu items we want to try.

First, the salsa that comes with the complimentary chips and salsa is the best we've ever had.  Thick, rich and perfectly seasoned...a great way to tantalize your taste buds for the entree to follow.  Then we had to share a bowl of their award-winning chicken corn chowder, which we find ourselves addicted to.  Don't sleep on that appetizer - it's simply delicious.

Then the entrees - this time I tried the SW Chicken Pasta, one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had anywhere.  Since the dish is made to order, I ordered it without beans and without tomatoes, and it was beautifully presented and SO GOOD.  My wife had the Taco Tuesday special with a crab cake taco and a guacamole taco, which she loved equally.

Our server, Lauren, highly recommended the fish and chips special on Friday nights so we hope to see you there!

vjAbS4qS6CmutM8mdebH4g,0,2018-10-30 00:53:04,0,8RkUQC5pdl6inSEe9dcO3w,"I have long debated on how to write this review for Beteena because all of her other reviews are so good. I went to Beteena BECAUSE of all of the amazing reviews I found online. However, my experience could not have been further from what other women experienced and I felt it was important to write an honest review.

My wedding was Oct. 19th and I took my dress to Beteena mid August. At my first meeting with her, after she stared me up and down for a few minutes she said to me, ""You need to lose 5 pounds, 8 would be better."" (as an aside, I am a usual size 8-10 and my wedding dress was a size 16). She also went on to tell me that the material of my dress was practically impossible to work on and asked me how much it was because she also took that into consideration when deciding her pricing. In addition to losing weight she told me that ""it was such a shame that I spent so much money on a dress that didn't have the seams tacked down and wasn't complete"", (side note - the dress was finished and didn't have the seams tacked down intentionally). After her assessment, she told me she was going to have to take the straps in, create the bustle, and hem it - all for $750. Not really knowing what seamstresses usually charge, I assumed that was normal. Price aside, I left her store in tears, feeling pretty shitty about my self and actually hating my dress because of what she said. Fast forward 5 weeks, I lose 10 pounds, and I am back at Beteena's store excited to see how the dress fits after following her instructions. I put on the dress and walk out to show Beteena and she says (in her extremely cold tone) ""Yes, looks much better, but it's still not right. Loosing weight didn't help much."" 

So she pinned the dress where it needed to be pinned - all the while complaining about the material and how hard it was going to be to sew and not sure if she could complete it. After she finished pinning, I walked into the dressing room to change. When I walked out Beteena comes back over and tells me that since there is SO much more work to be done since I lost weight (which she told me to do) the new cost to alter the dress was going to be $1,170. It is important to point out here that there is not a stitch of lace or one bead on my dress. I now have less than a month to my wedding and I start crying in the middle of her store and say, ""no, I am not paying that."" She then tries to explain why it costs so much and tells me that ""yes, I am much more expensive than everyone else because I pay such close attention to detail."" She then continues to tell me there was nothing that could be done based on the material of my dress and she wasn't even sure she would be able to complete it even if I did pay her and she wasn't sure if anyone would be able to alter the dress (not something you want to hear 3 weeks from your wedding after already spending $2000+ on a gown). 

I leave Beteena's store in tears for the second time, absolutely hating my dress and panicked. Which, yes, seems dramatic, but if you are planning a wedding you will understand why I was crying when you get to 3 weeks out. I start asking friends for recommendations for other seamstresses and someone gives me the name and number of Peggy. 

To wrap up this long review, I went to see Peggy (who laughed out loud when I told her what Beteena was charging me) and she saved my dress. I will forever be grateful to her. Peggy met with me three days after I left Beteena's store in tears. After I tried the dress on for her she said, ""Okay, this should be easy. I'll have it done in a week and it will be $125."" Peggy did a PERFECT job for $1,000+ less than what Beteena was going to charge. 

To say the least, my experience with Beteena was not great. To Beteena's credit, when I went to pick up my dress after I stormed out of her store in tears she did ask how she could have handled the situation better and was remorseful when I explained how offended I was by her and how terrible she made me feel. I do not think that Beteena is a bad person or a bad seamstress but I would not recommend her based on my experience.",0,t8ZIagvc_lUDnJ5ZVpnO7Q

For lava cakes and crepes, 0109 is one of the few that offers it in this area. I think 0109 is nice for desserts if you live in the area and you want a break from chinese desserts. However, if I lived in another city, I will not come to Markham/Scarborough area for cakes and crepes. 

I came here once when it was really new, it was really long ago. I still remember it was very dark and cozy. But I came back recently and the ambience changed. It is more bright now, looking more casual than before. 

Service: Service was great. Servers were attentive and brought water. It also wasn't very busy so it is easy for servers to keep an eye on all tables. 

Desserts: 

1) Matcha Lava Cake: I was excited to have this. I came on a chilly day and a lava cake was perfect to have on this chilly day. This was very disappointing. The cake was veryy DRY. It was like it was pre-made and then they warmed it up. I had a matcha lava cake before somewhere else at another dessert shop in uptown and it was delicious. But the one here was dry and it wasn't a nice cake in general. The cake also lacks in matcha flavor. I would rate this 2/5

2) Crepe: Lindt chocolate cake with added strawberries and bananas. Plus a scoop of cappuccino gelato. This was decent. I loved the gelato, it stood out from the crepe itself. It had a strong flavor and it was really creamy. I would rate this 3/5

We ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken tikka.  We are those rare people who actually don't like spicy food but love Indian as long as it's cooked VERY Mild.  So I always order super, super mild.  It had no heat at all so he nailed it on the first attempt, which almost never happens for us.

The flavor was AMAZING.  The sauce had an incredibly fresh taste brimming with intense flavors and fresh herbs, so much so we couldn't get enough.  It's not exactly the taste I remember from our days in California but unlike other Indian restaurants that fall short at imitating the taste, this was just so amazingly unique in taste that I'd put it on par with the best I've had, just uniquely different.

Since our favorite Indian place in AZ closed (India's Grill), we've been disappointed over and over trying to find another place.  This will be our new favorite.

Just be aware, it's really only good for takeout.  As others noted, it's so tiny and not really outfitted for dine in.  Also, it's really hard to find because it's so tiny.  The storefront is only about 10 feet wide and it's tucked between a Chinese restaurant and a nail salon.  I drove by twice and didn't spot it; the owner had to talk me to it!

And as other's have noted, it's truly the owner and one other person cooking everything from scratch so it takes longer (over 45 minutes from the time I ordered).  But there's something really quaint about the whole experience; it's like you're visiting their home and they're whipping up some home cooking back in the kitchen.

Back when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.

As anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  ""What the heck?"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!

Since I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.

Before I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  ""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.

Don't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.

I won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, ""The Value Parking Network,"" is laughable and downright disingenuous.",4,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A

There were cherry tomatoes, avocado and artichokes in the salad too. The dressing was very good as well. We also had the fish tacos'. They were delicious too. We had a side of fries to and they were nicely seasoned. 

For drink: Margarita and mojito. The mojito was definitely better than the 'rita. I dont like the fake syrupy stuff. They didn't use fresh squeezed (key ingredient!) lime juice. Cheap tequila. No Grand Marnier floater like a really good 'rita has. The mojitio was better, and it did have fresh mint, but it was only OK. I guess we should have gotten the bottle!

The Scene: lots of scantily clad early 20's pretty girls taking orders and bringing drinks. They have male runners bring the food. Lots of people, in their mid 20's to early 30's drinking. A LOT. Since most of these are friends and family and employee's I'm sure this was toned down. A DJ playing good music. A table full of good food and drink. Me likey!

I wish we would have gotten there a little sooner and wish I could have stayed a little later. It was cool. DJ playing music, tons and tons of people walking around drinking. On one hand I did feel a little old, on the other, if I didnt work that day and have to work the next, I'd probably be, no, I *would* be one of the tons of drunk people. Instead, I went to Embers and had a FANTASTIC time at the elite event. 

I wish I could say I'd come back here. But I wont. Why? It's crazy expensive. We didn't pay to get in, or for the 1 free drink we each got. BUT the high roller cool sh*t we got came with a ""bill"" but it was ""comped"". For ONE carafe of mojito, 1 ahi tuna salad, 1 side of fries and 1 order of fish taco's the bill came to $149.00! They was no table charge, and I dont think I saw a fruit platter charge, and we didn't pay to get in OR those drinks, so, this would have been, what, a $300+ day if we had truly paid for each and every thing. Getting all that stuff was great, I loved it, and I'm thankful for it. I just would not spend my own money on that. If you have tons and tons of cash to spend on something like this, then you'd probably love it.",1,8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q

Hanoi is a perfect example of a differentiated top performer.  Their soup was very pleasant and flavourful yet light and not too salty, and they use a more transparent noodle version which is different to the typical pho places.  It was a very pleasant light meal.  

Only thing is they come in 1 size only, so you can't pick an XL for the starving boys.

Also, I wasn't as impressed with the sides I ordered...when I go to a restaurant and order mussels i would be expecting fresh muscles, not those big one shell packaged mussels.  (even though I have to admit it was cooked in a nice way)

There were two cool teachers. That's it. Save your money and go to Aveda. They work with you until you get it right. You're paying 20k which is a thousand more than Avalon but for the learning and experience I'm more than willing. They actually have state board training during the final phase and master series (classes) from barbers to color and cut specialists and so much more from Hattori Hanzo and the Aveda Network. Even people who have just heard about Aveda products want to come in and see what we're about from all over the the country.

We started with the Spring Rolls which, oddly enough, came out after our entrees. The Spring Rolls were a bit of a disappointment... a bit too greasy and kind of plain in taste. 

I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised. 

I also tried the Honey Peach drink. This was very good if a bit sweet. I will definitely try another flavor next time since they have 5+ flavors to choose from.

They came out for an estimate the day we called for information and were honest and open about various charges and how we could potentially save money.  
The day of the move we had a window of arrival between 8-8:30.   They arrived by 7:45 and got to work right away.  Blankets and protective material were laid throughout the apartment to keep everything clean.  After a quick walk through, they made a plan for packing and loading and got to work.
The guys were extremely friendly.  They were even kind to our cat.  She was scared and had been hiding under the bed.  One of them came out holding her and petting her trying to calm her down.  It was so sweet!
The move into our house went equally as smooth.  They were very careful in placement of furniture and even suggested how to secure cabinets to the walls (as they knew I have infant twins).
The job was done quickly and professionally and everything went off without a hitch.
One thing to note is that if you pay via credit card, there is a $25 fee.

We should all make an effort to support local business such as this, but this place makes it a complete joy to do so- full tummies and all. 

On a recent visit to my home town, we hosted my mothers birthday dinner here. The food was so good we came back again before we left town. You simply can't go wrong here. The entire table loved their mains, everything  from the Lamb chops to the Lasagna. You do have to come with some patience but trust me when I say it pays off- as the head Chef (Dad) plates up every dish himself and makes sure it's noting short of perfect. Two of our guests ordered the Lamb Chops which came out cooked to perfection, literally. Not undercooked or overcooked, just cooked perfectly- which by the way even the best of restaurants can't seem to nail. The rest of us carb loving people ordered pasta and weren't at all disappointed. If my husbands comment doesn't put it in perspective, I don't know what does- ""I love you and your lasagna but this is the best lasagna I've ever had."" Promptly followed by a kiss of course, soften the blow. But I don't mind, because on our second trip back to this gem, I order d the lasagna and he was right! So good. I need to up my lasagna game. 

As for Wine, they have a good selection. They carry genuine Chianti from Italy. Which is impressive. To be a genuine chianti it has to the have the black Rooster label and a serial number as this specific type of wine is governed by the Italian government. If you ever have a bottle of Chianti without these two distinguishing marks- it's not legit. I learnt all of this during a trip to Italy last year, and legit chianti is truly delicious. 


Bottomline, this is the place to go for a traditional Italian experience- from the wine to the food. Reservations recommended.",2,PUQFBO57wiRZRnUOpaiSXw

THE FOOD:  Skin-on mashed potatoes, pork chops, stuffed cabbage, (all good) garlicy and and inconsitantly cooked green beans.  The stand out was the table full of old-fashioned ethnic cookies-- nut rolls and the like.  It really brought me back.   

THE SERVICE:  Cute old Slovenian ladies and a gentleman.  All polite and sweet, just as you'd expect.

The meal traditionally includes a fairly sized burrito, corn chips, grilled veggies, guacamole, and salsa.   This is for the whopping price of $15!  Now, they cut the veggies and substituted them with lettuce.  Literally pieces of lettuce. In addition, they removed the guacamole and and salsa. But the funny thing is they didn't lower the price at all.  And the menu didn't display any of these changes.  I think they instituted these changes to save money and inventory, but it was a poor choice.

We were offered and ordered a pre-meal cocktail. 
At that time we met the staff and were asked if we had a show that evening. We said no, that dinner was the highlight of the evening. 

Shortly after we ordered our cocktails we placed our orders. I was a bit surprised they did not offer to explain anything on the menu; however we were discussing the Tasting Menu so I assume they knew we already wanted that. We placed our orders and before we could finish our cocktails the first course was at the table. The Sommelier arrived, who was funny and cordial, to describe the first wine. The first course was yellowtail, and delicious, my husband got the crab which was divine. As soon as we finished the food it was cleared and nearly as quickly they brought the glasses for the next course. Again, I was surprised because we all still had half our pre dinner cocktail and at least half of the first glass of wine. The second course came, amazing risotto, and the speediness repeatedly itself again. Finally, my husband asked them to slow down because the course were coming so fast we were barely able finish our previous course and unable to finish our drinks. The waiter apologized and mentioned they were used to getting people to shows. We stated again we didn't have a show. He said he would take cues from my husband. At this point, the service switched, the sommelier came out for 2nd wine, but not the 3rd and despite my husband trying to signal the waiter repeatedly it took 3-4 attempts (understandably he had other tables) to catch his attention so it took almost 3.5 more hours to complete our remaining courses.

rq9CwVtuJDhML2MTN268JA,1,2015-06-28 23:02:35,0,0SXmkMLshfxF0KFIqEvQtg,My wife and I both bought e-bikes from Crazy Lenny's and we couldn't have had a better experience.  The sales staff was knowledgable and they let us try a number of models on the bike path located next to the store until we arrived at a bike that suited each of our individual needs.  I actually returned the first one I purchased and they allowed me to take another that was a better fit.  They had the best price in addition to the best buying experience.  Lenny checked in with us during our initial visit and actually handled the exchange for me.,2,Ca4m4aemuOrR65PEUPM8gg

Reviews for Barbarians seemed good so I made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday 3 weeks in advance. We showed up at exactly 8:30 with about 3 other couples arriving within 2 minutes of us. We were all told there was about a five minute wait and they gave us some bubbly wine to compensate. BF and I thought that was a nice touch since 5 minutes was not a long wait. 30 minutes later, one pair of couples were seated while the line up at the door continued to grow and we were anxiously, hungrily waiting for our table. The other two waiting couples were seated before us and then around 9:10 we were finally brought to our table by the manager who said ""I will take care of you to ensure a special evening"". We were brought to the worst table in the whole restaurant right in front of the kitchen where you can see and hear everything. We saw another table being cleared and asked to move. The waiter gave us attitude but allowed the change. Once seated we waited another 10 minutes for menus, water, bread and dill veggies. I was driving so I chose not to drink (also high wine prices). BF ordered a vodka (not premium) which we found out cost $13.00. We ordered our meal (shared ceaser salad, filet mignon & NY Sirloin. The salad came out on two plates but we were not offered some fresh pepper. It had a decent taste but was nothing special. About 10 minutes later the food came out (a bit quick for my liking being at a ""fancy"" steakhouse). Bf's steak tasted completely burnt with no flavor so we asked to send it back. Their excuse ""it's charred"". Our response, it's burnt. My steak was over cooked and had zero flavors. Disappointing. Tried to wait to eat with BF when his steak came out but it was taking twenty minutes. The baked potatoes (I asked if I could switch to mashed and was told ""no substitution) were cold and drenched in toppings. We asked for a bit of bacon and the cheese to add flavor but there was more of the toppings than there was potato. The second steak received was not much better than the first. Not once did anyone come to ask how the food was or if it was better. Halfway through the eating of the steaks I realized our water had also not been filled in at least 15 minutes. I kept trying to get a waiters attention but kept getting ignored to the point where I went to the bar to get my own water. We were so disappointed. I had also called the day before to remind them it is for a birthday for the gentleman I will be with. They did bring a ""cake"" at the end which ended up being the apple beignets. They basically throw it on the table and mutter happy birthday. They also gave it to me instead of my boyfriend even after clear instructions. The dessert was also disappointing as it was not a donut but an apple shaped as a donut with way too much cinnamon. The bill arrived without being asked if we wanted tea or coffee or anything else. I noticed that the steak was not removed from the bill which would have been a nice touch. Everything, including the dessert was charged which I was upset about especially after our horrible experience. The manager never came to see us or ask how the meal or evening was even though we noticed him schmoozing with other guests. We were certainly not ""taken care of"" as earlier told. At this point I decided to tell the manager about our experience. I started with ""I will be paying for this meal but this is what happened and why we had a negative experience"" and before he even let me continue he took the bill, said don't pay, don't come back and please leave. What terrible customer service. Not only will I never go back but I will make sure no one I know or ever speak to goes there either. The birthday meal was completely ruined. Other than the pickles we were utterly disappointed and have nothing positive to remember from Barberian's. For the price you are better off going to the Keg (less money, better service and way better food) or spending more and going to one of the nicer steakhouses like Ruth Chris, Morton's or Jacobs. Stay far away from Barberian's unless you want an evening of annoyances and disappointment.",4,V0-T0t0-PxGplODVS9bT2A

Great vegetarian options and delicious choices for meat eaters as well. We tried the ramen, vegetable goyzas, scallion pancake, fried tofu in broth, pork short ribs, fried chicken and edamame. All delicious!!! Finished it off with a super yummy passion fruit cake. Great service, ambience and nice outdoor seating! Overall an excellent dining experience!",0,yHKuxTiiNACjIsHEKoVTRQ

- Yaki Udon. Very salty with uneven cuts of veggies of which some were partially cooked and came sopping in a ""soup"" of sauce that filled a quarter of the container. Let me tell you, there is nothing worse than stir fried noodles where the noodles are drippy in pure soya sauce.
- Steak Teriyaki. Similar where the meat was very tough, the rice came overcooked and soggy and sopping in sauce and again, most of the veggies were unevenly chopped and were still raw.

Most of the food ended up being inedible - what a shame!",1,9gX_LpIjPD3McOdKz8ixNQ

I recently moved to Vegas & have been to at least 5 salons looking for someone who can do acrylics that don't discolor, are thin, natural-looking & don't lift.   I've had so many bad  fills that I had nothing to lose trying Flamingo.  

Tina really took the time w/ my nails getting the old mis-shapen acrylic down & did a BEAUTIFUL job w/ the fill. They are very natural-looking (no funky humped up nail bed), nice & thin and the white is pure white. 

The salon isn't fancy & the day I was in there were only 2 techs working (Hannah & Tina) but those two were very busy & I STRONGLY recommend an appointment.  Over the hour & half I was there, they turned away 3 people because they were already booked past regular closing time (yes, they booked an appointment after hours so very customer-oriented). 

Prices are what I am used to from the east coast...$35 for a fill so not cheap like I think people expect due to the number of places around town, but not the crazy $55 I paid at another salon (check my reviews). 

I usually go 4-5 weeks between fills so I'll update on how well they do over time, but right now I am one HAPPY-HAPPY girl!",1,FISzlNZgrFylvgX3Nl_a5w
